Cuchulain has killed kings, Kings and sons of kings, Dragons out of the water and witches out of the air, Banachas and Bonachas and people of the woods. Witches that steal the milk, Fomor that steal the children, Hags that have heads like hares, Hares that have claws like witches, All riding a-cock-horse, Out of the very bottom of the bitter black north.
