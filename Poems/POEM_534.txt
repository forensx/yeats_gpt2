At the dirty end of Dirty Lane, Liv’d a dirty cobbler, Dick Maclane; His wife was in the old king’s reign A stout brave orange-woman. On Essex Bridge she strained her throat, And six-a-penny was her note. But Dickey wore a bran-new coat, He got among the yeomen. He was a bigot, like his clan, And in the streets he wildly sang, O Roly, toly, toly raid, with his old jade.
