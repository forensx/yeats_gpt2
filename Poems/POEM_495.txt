May this fire have driven out The shape-changers that can put Ruin on a great king’s house, Until all be ruinous. Names whereby a man has known The threshold and the hearthstone, Gather on the wind and drive Women none can kiss and thrive, For they are but whirling wind, Out of memory and mind. They would make a prince decay With light images of clay Planted in the running wave; Or for many shapes they have, They would change them into hounds Until he had died of his wounds Though the change were but a whim; Or they’d hurl a spell at him, That he follow with desire Bodies that can never tire Or grow kind, for they anoint All their bodies joint by joint With a miracle-working juice [227]That is made out of the grease Of the ungoverned unicorn; But the man is thrice forlorn Emptied, ruined, wracked, and lost, That they follow, for at most They will give him kiss for kiss While they murmur “After this Hatred may be sweet to the taste;” Those wild hands that have embraced All his body can but shove At the burning wheel of love Till the side of hate comes up. Therefore in this ancient cup May the sword-blades drink their fill Of the home-brew there, until They will have for master none But the threshold and hearthstone.
