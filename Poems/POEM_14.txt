I have seen, I have seen![111] What do you cry aloud? The ever-living have shown me what’s to come. How? Where? In the ashes of the bowl. While you were holding it between your hands? Speak quickly! I have seen Cuchulain’s roof-tree Leap into fire, and the walls split and blacken. Cuchulain has gone out to die. O! O![112] Who could have thought that one so great as he Should meet his end at this unnoted sword! Life drifts between a fool and a blind man To the end, and nobody can know his end. Come, look upon the quenching of this greatness. No crying out, for there’ll be need of cries And knocking at the breast when it’s all finished.
