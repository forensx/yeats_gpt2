I do not know if days Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays Shone many times among the glimmering flowers Wove in her flower-like hair, before dark towers Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed About them; and the horse of faery screamed And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears, Nor ceased until white Niamh stroked his ears And named him by sweet names.
