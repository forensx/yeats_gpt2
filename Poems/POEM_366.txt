The dance wound through the windless woods; The ever-summered solitudes; Until the tossing arms grew still Upon the woody central hill; And, gathered in a panting band, We flung on high each waving hand, And sang unto the starry broods: In our raised eyes there flashed a glow Of milky brightness to and fro As thus our song arose: ‘You stars, Across your wandering ruby cars Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God, He rules you with an iron rod, He holds you with an iron bond, Each one woven to the other, Each one woven to his brother Like bubbles in a frozen pond; But we in a lonely land abide Unchainable as the dim tide, With hearts that know nor law nor rule, And hands that hold no wearisome tool; Folded in love that fears no morrow, Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.’
