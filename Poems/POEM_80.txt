Friend of these many years, you too had stood With equal courage in that whirling rout; For you, although you’ve not her wandering heart, Have all that greatness, and not hers alone. For there is no high story about queens In any ancient book but tells of you; And when I’ve heard how they grew old and died, Or fell into unhappiness, I’ve said: ‘She will grow old and die, and she has wept!’ And when I’d write it out anew, the words, Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept! Outrun the measure. I’d tell of that great queen Who stood amid a silence by the thorn Until two lovers came out of the air With bodies made out of soft fire. The one, About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings, Said: ‘Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.’ [50]Then Maeve: ‘O Aengus, Master of all lovers, A thousand years ago you held high talk With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan. O when will you grow weary?’ They had vanished; But out of the dark air over her head there came A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.
