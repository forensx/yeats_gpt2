O wandering birds and rushy beds, You put such folly in our heads With all this crying in the wind; No common love is to our mind, And our poor Kate or Nan is less Than any whose unhappiness Awoke the harp-strings long ago. Yet they that know all things but know That all life had to give us is A child’s laughter, a woman’s kiss. [55]Who was it put so great a scorn In the grey reeds that night and morn Are trodden and broken by the herds, And in the light bodies of birds That north wind tumbles to and fro And pinches among hail and snow?
