What shall I call them? fish that swim, Scale rubbing scale where light is dim By a broad water-lily leaf; [59]Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf Forgotten at the threshing place; Or birds lost in the one clear space Of morning light in a dim sky; Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye, Or the door pillars of one house, Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs That have one shadow on the ground; Or the two strings that made one sound Where that wise harper’s finger ran. For this young girl and this young man Have happiness without an end, Because they have made so good a friend.
