I have a story right, my wanderers, [130]That has so mixed with fable in our songs, That all seemed fabulous. We are come, by chance, Into King Conchubar�s country, and this house Is an old guest-house built for travellers From the seashore to Conchubar�s royal house, And there are certain hills among these woods, And there Queen Deirdre grew. That famous queen Who has been wandering with her lover, Naisi, And none to friend but lovers and wild hearts? Some dozen years ago, King Conchubar found A house upon a hillside in this wood, And there a comely child with an old witch To nurse her, and there�s nobody can say If she were human, or of those begot By an invisible king of the air in a storm On a king�s daughter, or anything at all Of who she was or why she was hidden there But that she�d too much beauty for good luck. He went up thither daily, till at last She put on womanhood, and he lost peace, [131]And Deirdre�s tale began. The King was old. A month or so before the marriage day, A young man, in the laughing scorn of his youth, Naisi, the son of Usnach, climbed up there, And having wooed, or, as some say, been wooed, Carried her off. The tale were well enough Had it a finish. Hush! I have more to tell; But gather close that I may whisper it: I speak of terrible, mysterious ends� The secrets of a king. There�s none to hear! I have been to Conchubar�s house, and followed up A crowd of servants going out and in With loads upon their heads: embroideries To hang upon the walls, or new-mown rushes To strew upon the floors, and came at length To a great room.[132] Be silent; there are steps! You are musicians by these instruments, And if as seems�for you are comely women� You can praise love, you�ll have the best of luck, For there�ll be two, before the night is in, That bargained for their love, and paid for it All that men value. You have but the time To weigh a happy music with the sad; To find what is most pleasing to a lover, Before the son of Usnach and his queen Have passed this threshold. Deirdre and her man! I thought to find a message from the king, And ran to meet it. Is there no messenger From Conchubar to Fergus, son of Rogh? I was to have found a message in this house. Are Deirdre and her lover tired of life?[133] You are not of this country, or you�d know That they are in my charge, and all forgiven. We have no country but the roads of the world. Then you should know that all things change in the world, And hatred turns to love and love to hate, And even kings forgive. An old man�s love Who casts no second line, is hard to cure; His jealousy is like his love. And that�s but true. You have learned something in your wanderings. He was so hard to cure, that the whole court, But I alone, thought it impossible; Yet after I had urged it at all seasons, I had my way, and all�s forgiven now; And you shall speak the welcome and the joy That I lack tongue for.[134] Yet old men are jealous. I am Conchubar�s near friend, and that weighed somewhat, And it was policy to pardon them. The need of some young, famous, popular man To lead the troops, the murmur of the crowd, And his own natural impulse, urged him to it. They have been wandering half-a-dozen years. And yet old men are jealous. Sing the more sweetly Because, though age is arid as a bone, This man has flowered. I�ve need of music, too; If this gray head would suffer no reproach, I�d dance and sing�and dance till the hour ran out, Because I have accomplished this good deed. [135]Look there�there at the window, those dark men, With murderous and outlandish-looking arms� They�ve been about the house all day. What are you? Where do you come from, who is it sent you here? They will not answer you. They do not hear. Forgive my open speech, but to these eyes That have seen many lands, they are such men As kings will gather for a murderous task, That neither bribes, commands, nor promises Can bring their people to. And that is why [136]You harped upon an old man�s jealousy. A trifle sets you quaking. Conchubar�s fame Brings merchandise on every wind that blows. They may have brought him Libyan dragon-skin, Or the ivory of the fierce unicorn. If these be merchants, I have seen the goods They have brought to Conchubar, and understood His murderous purpose. Murderous, you say? Why, what new gossip of the roads is this? But I�ll not hear. It may be life or death. There is a room in Conchubar�s house, and there� Be silent, or I�ll drive you from the door. There�s many a one that would do more than that, And make it prison, or death, or banishment To slander the High King. He is my friend; I have his oath, and I am well content. I have known his mind as if it were my own These many years, and there is none alive Shall buzz against him, and I there to stop it. I know myself, and him, and your wild thought Fed on extravagant poetry, and lit By such a dazzle of old fabulous tales That common things are lost, and all that�s strange Is true because �twere pity if it were not. Quick! quick! your instruments! they are coming now. I hear the hoofs a-clatter. Begin that song; But what is it to be? I�d have them hear A music foaming up out of the house Like wine out of a cup. Come now, a verse Of some old time not worth remembering, And all the lovelier because a bubble. Begin, begin, of some old king and queen, Of Lugaidh Redstripe or another; no, not him, He and his lady perished wretchedly. �Why is it,� Queen Edain said, �If I do but climb the stair.�.�.�.�
[138] Ah! that is better.�.�.�. They are alighted now. Shake all your cockscombs, children; these are lovers. �Why is it,� Queen Edain said, �If I do but climb the stair To the tower overhead, When the winds are calling there, Or the gannets calling out, In waste places of the sky, There�s so much to think about, That I cry, that I cry?� But her goodman answered her: �Love would be a thing of naught Had not all his limbs a stir Born out of immoderate thought; Were he anything by half, Were his measure running dry. Lovers, if they may not laugh, Have to cry, have to cry.� But is Edain worth a song Now the hunt begins anew? Praise the beautiful and strong; Praise the redness of the yew; Praise the blossoming apple-stem. But our silence had been wise. What is all our praise to them, That have one another�s eyes? You are welcome, lady. Conchubar has not come. Were the peace honest, he�d have come himself To prove it so. [140]Being no more in love, He stays in his own house, arranging where The curlew and the plover go, and where The speckled heath-cock in a golden dish. But there�s no messenger. He�ll come himself When all�s in readiness and night closed in; But till that hour, these birds out of the waste Shall put his heart and mind into the music. There�s many a day that I have almost wept To think that one so delicately made Might never know the sweet and natural life Of women born to that magnificence, Quiet and music, courtesy and peace. I have found life obscure and violent, And think it ever so; but none the less I thank you for your kindness, and thank these That put it into music. Your house has been The hole of the badger or the den of the fox; [141]But all that�s finished, and your days will pass From this day out where life is smooth on the tongue, Because the grapes were trodden long ago. If I was childish, and had faith in omens, I�d rather not have lit on that old chessboard At my home-coming. There�s a tale about it� It has been lying there these many years� Some wild old sorrowful tale. It is the board Where Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his, Who had a seamew�s body half the year, Played at the chess upon the night they died. I can remember now a tale of treachery, A broken promise and a journey�s end; But it were best forgot. If the tale is true, [142]When it was plain that they had been betrayed, They moved the men, and waited for the end, As it were bedtime, and had so quiet minds They hardly winked their eyes when the sword flashed. She never could have played so, being a woman, If she had not the cold sea�s blood in her. I have heard that th� ever-living warn mankind By changing clouds, and casual accidents, Or what seem so. If there had been ill luck In lighting on this chessboard of a sudden, This flagon that stood on it when we came Has made all right again, for it should mean All wrongs forgiven, hospitality For bitter memory, peace after war, While that loaf there should add prosperity. Deirdre will see the world, as it were, new-made, If she�ll but eat and drink. The flagon�s dry, [143]Full of old cobwebs, and the bread is mouldy, Left by some traveller gone upon his way These many weeks. No one to welcome us, And a bare house upon the journey�s end. Is that the welcome that a king spreads out For those that he would honour? Hush! no more. You are King Conchubar�s guest, being in his house. You speak as women do that sit alone, Marking the ashes with a stick till they Are in a dreamy terror. Being a queen, You should have too calm thought to start at shadows. Come, let us look if there�s a messenger From Conchubar�s house. A little way without One sees the road for half a mile or so, Where the trees thin or thicken. When those we love Speak words unfitting to the ear of kings, Kind ears are deaf.[144] Before you came I had to threaten these that would have weighed Some crazy phantasy of their own brain Or gossip of the road with Conchubar�s word. If I had thought so little of mankind I never could have moved him to this pardon. I have believed the best of every man, And find that to believe it is enough To make a bad man show him at his best, Or even a good man swing his lantern higher. If anything lies heavy on your heart, Speak freely of it, knowing it is certain That you will never see my face again. You�ve been in love? [145]If you would speak of love, Speak freely. There is nothing in the world That has been friendly to us but the kisses That were upon our lips, and when we are old Their memory will be all the life we have. There was a man that loved me. He was old; I could not love him. Now I can but fear. He has made promises, and brought me home; But though I turn it over in my thoughts, I cannot tell if they are sound and wholesome, Or hackles on the hook. I have heard he loved you, As some old miser loves the dragon-stone He hides among the cobwebs near the roof. You mean that when a man who has loved like that Is after crossed, love drowns in its own flood, And that love drowned and floating is but hate. And that a king who hates, sleeps ill at night, Till he has killed, and that, though the day laughs, We shall be dead at cockcrow.[146] You have not my thought. When I lost one I loved distractedly, I blamed my crafty rival and not him, And fancied, till my passion had run out, That could I carry him away with me, And tell him all my love, I�d keep him yet. Ah! now I catch your meaning, that this king Will murder Naisi, and keep me alive. �Tis you that put that meaning upon words Spoken at random. Wanderers like you, Who have their wit alone to keep their lives, Speak nothing that is bitter to the ear At random; if they hint at it at all Their eyes and ears have gathered it so lately That it is crying out in them for speech. We have little that is certain.[147] Certain or not, Speak it out quickly, I beseech you to it; I never have met any of your kind, But that I gave them money, food, and fire. There are strange, miracle-working, wicked stones, Men tear out of the heart and the hot brain Of Libyan dragons. The hot Istain stone, And the cold stone of Fanes, that have power To stir even those at enmity to love. They have so great an influence, if but sewn In the embroideries that curtain in The bridal bed. O Mover of the stars That made this delicate house of ivory, And made my soul its mistress, keep it safe. [148]I have seen a bridal bed, so curtained in, So decked for miracle in Conchubar�s house, And learned that a bride�s coming. And I the bride? Here is worse treachery than the seamew suffered, For she but died and mixed into the dust Of her dear comrade, but I am to live And lie in the one bed with him I hate. Where is Naisi? I was not alone like this When Conchubar first chose me for his wife; I cried in sleeping or waking and he came, But now there is worse need. Why have you called? I was but standing there, without the door. The horses are still saddled, follow me, And hurry to our ships, and get us gone. There�s naught to fear; the king�s forgiven all. [149]She has the heart of a wild bird that fears The net of the fowler or the wicker cage, And has been ever so. Although it�s hard, It is but needful that I stand against you, And if I did not you�d despise me for it, As women do the husbands that they lead Whether for good or evil. I have heard Monstrous, terrible, mysterious things, Magical horrors and the spells of wizards. Why, that�s no wonder, you�ve been listening To singers of the roads that gather up The tales of the whole world, and when they weary Imagine new, or lies about the living, Because their brains are ever upon fire. Is then the king that sends no messenger, And leaves an empty house before a guest, So clear in all he does that no dim word Can light us to a doubt? However dim, [150]Speak it, for I have known King Conchubar Better than my own heart, and I can quench Whatever words have made you doubt him. No, I cannot weigh the gossip of the roads With a king�s word, and were the end but death, I may not doubt him. Naisi, I must speak. Let us begone, this house is no fit place, Being full of doubt�Deirdre is right. No, no, Not by that door that opens on the path That runs to the seashore, but this that leads To Conchubar�s house. We�ll wait no messenger, But go to his well-lighted house, and there Where the rich world runs up into a wick And that burns steadily, because no wind Can blow upon it, bring all doubts to an end. The table has been spread by this, the court Has ridden from all sides to welcome you To safety and to peace.[151] Safety and peace! I had them when a child, but never since. Men blame you that you have stirred a quarrel up That has brought death to many. I have poured Water upon the fire, but if you fly A second time the house is in a blaze And all the screaming household can but blame The savage heart of beauty for it all; And Naisi that but helped to tar the wisp Be but a hunted outlaw all his days. I will be blamed no more! there�s but one way. I�ll spoil this beauty that brought misery And houseless wandering on the man I loved, And so buy peace between him and the king. These wanderers will show me how to do it, To clip my hair to baldness, blacken my skin With walnut juice, and tear my face with briars. Oh! that wild creatures of the woods had torn This body with their claws. What is your meaning? What are you saying? That he loves you still?[152] Whatever were to happen to this face, I�d be myself; and there�s not any way But this way to bring trouble to an end. Answer me�does King Conchubar still love� Does he still covet you? Tell out the plot, The plan, the network, all the treachery, And of the bridal chamber and the bed, The magical stones, the wizard�s handiwork. Take care of Deirdre, if I die in this, For she must never fall into his hands, Whatever the cost. Where would you go to, Naisi? I go to drag the truth from Conchubar, Before his people, in the face of his army, And if it be as black as you have made it, To kill him there.[153] You never would return; I�d never look upon your face again. Oh, keep him, Fergus; do not let him go, But hold him from it. You are both wise and kind. When you were all but Conchubar�s wife, I took you; He tried to kill me, and he would have done it If I had been so near as I am now. And now that you are mine, he has planned to take you. Should I be less than Conchubar, being a man? Supper is on the table; Conchubar Is waiting for his guests. All�s well, again! All�s well! all�s well! You cried your doubts so loud, That I had almost doubted.[154] I would have killed him, And he the while but busy in his house For the more welcome. The message is not finished. Come quickly. Conchubar will laugh, that I� Although I held out boldly in my speech� That I, even I� Wait, wait! He is not done. That am so great a friend, have doubted him. Deirdre, and Fergus, son of Rogh, are summoned; But not the traitor that bore off the queen. It is enough that the king pardon her, And call her to his table and his bed. So, then, it�s treachery.[155] I�ll not believe it. Tell Conchubar to meet me in some place Where none can come between us but our swords. I have done my message; I am Conchubar�s man; I take no message from a traitor�s lips. No, but you must; and I will have you swear To carry it unbroken. He has been suborned. I know King Conchubar�s mind as it were my own; I�ll learn the truth from him. No, no, old man, You thought the best, and the worst came of it; We listened to the counsel of the wise, And so turned fools. But ride and bring your friends. Go, and go quickly. Conchubar has not seen me; It may be that his passion is asleep, And that we may escape. But I�ll go first, And follow up that Libyan heel, and send Such words to Conchubar, that he may know At how great peril he lays hands upon you. The Libyan, knowing that a servant�s life Is safe from hands like mine, but turned and mocked. I�ll call my friends, and call the reaping-hooks, And carry you in safety to the ships. My name has still some power. I will protect, Or, if that is impossible, revenge. The crib has fallen and the birds are in it; There is not one of the great oaks about us But shades a hundred men. Let�s out and die, Or break away, if the chance favour us. They would but drag you from me, stained with blood. Their barbarous weapons would but mar that beauty, And I would have you die as a queen should� In a death chamber. You are in my charge. We will wait here, and when they come upon us, I�ll hold them from the doors, and when that�s over, Give you a cleanly death with this grey edge. I will stay here; but you go out and fight. Our way of life has brought no friends to us, And if we do not buy them leaving it, We shall be ever friendless.[158] What do they say? That Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his Sat at this chessboard, waiting for their end. They knew that there was nothing that could save them, And so played chess as they had any night For years, and waited for the stroke of sword. I never heard a death so out of reach Of common hearts, a high and comely end: What need have I, that gave up all for love, To die like an old king out of a fable, Fighting and passionate? What need is there For all that ostentation at my setting? I have loved truly and betrayed no man. I need no lightning at the end, no beating In a vain fury at the cage�s door. Had you been here when that man and his queen Played at so high a game, could you have found An ancient poem for the praise of it? It should have set out plainly that those two, Because no man and woman have loved better, Might sit on there contentedly, and weigh The joy comes after. I have heard the seamew [159]Sat there, with all the colour in her cheeks, As though she�d say: �There�s nothing happening But that a king and queen are playing chess.� He�s in the right, though I have not been born Of the cold, haughty waves. My veins are hot. But though I have loved better than that queen, I�ll have as quiet fingers on the board. Oh, singing women, set it down in a book That love is all we need, even though it is But the last drops we gather up like this; And though the drops are all we have known of life, For we have been most friendless�praise us for it And praise the double sunset, for naught�s lacking, But a good end to the long, cloudy day. Light torches there and drive the shadows out, For day�s red end comes up. Make no sad music. What is it but a king and queen at chess? They need a music that can mix itself Into imagination, but not break The steady thinking that the hard game needs. Love is an immoderate thing And can never be content, Till it dip an ageing wing, Where some laughing element Leaps and Time�s old lanthorn dims. What�s the merit in love-play, In the tumult of the limbs That dies out before �tis day, Heart on heart, or mouth on mouth, All that mingling of our breath, When love-longing is but drouth For the things come after death? I cannot go on playing like that woman That had but the cold blood of the sea in her veins.[161] It is your move. Take up your man again. Do you remember that first night in the woods We lay all night on leaves, and looking up, When the first grey of the dawn awoke the birds, Saw leaves above us. You thought that I still slept, And bending down to kiss me on the eyes, Found they were open. Bend and kiss me now, For it may be the last before our death. And when that�s over, we�ll be different; Imperishable things, a cloud or a fire. And I know nothing but this body, nothing But that old vehement, bewildering kiss. Children, beware! He has taken up my challenge; Whether I am a ghost or living man When day has broken, I�ll forget the rest, And say that there is kingly stuff in him. He came to spy upon us, not to fight. A prudent hunter, therefore, but no king. He�d find if what has fallen in the pit Were worth the hunting, but has come too near, And I turn hunter. You�re not man, but beast. Go scurry in the bushes, now, beast, beast, For now it�s topsy-turvy, I upon you. You have a knife there thrust into your girdle. I�d have you give it me. No, but I dare not. No, but you must. If harm should come to you, They�d know I gave it. [163]There is no mark on this To make it different from any other Out of a common forge. You have taken it, I did not give it you; but there are times When such a thing is all the friend one has. The leaves hide all, and there�s no way to find What path to follow. Why is there no sound? Where would you go? To strike a blow for Naisi, If Conchubar call the Libyans to his aid. But why is there no clash? They have met by this! Listen. I am called far-seeing. If Conchubar win, You have a woman�s wile that can do much, Even with men in pride of victory. He is in love and old. What were one knife Among a hundred?[164] Women, if I die, If Naisi die this night, how will you praise? What words seek out? for that will stand to you; For being but dead we shall have many friends. All through your wanderings, the doors of kings Shall be thrown wider open, the poor man�s hearth Heaped with new turf, because you are wearing this  ������    [Gives MUSICIAN a bracelet. To show that you have Deirdre�s story right. Have you not been paid servants in love�s house To sweep the ashes out and keep the doors? And though you have suffered all for mere love�s sake You�d live your lives again. Even this last hour. [165]One woman and two men; that is a quarrel That knows no mending. Bring the man she chose Because of his beauty and the strength of his youth. I have been taken like a bird or a fish. He cried �Beast, beast!� and in a blind-beast rage He ran at me and fell into the nets, But we were careful for your sake, and took him With all the comeliness that woke desire Unbroken in him. I being old and lenient� I would not hurt a hair upon his head. What do you say? Have you forgiven him? He is but mocking us. What�s left to say Now that the seven years� hunt is at an end? [166]He never doubted you until I made him, And therefore all the blame for what he says Should fall on me. But his young blood is hot, And if we�re of one mind, he shall go free, And I ask nothing for it, or, if something, Nothing I could not take. There is no king In the wide world that, being so greatly wronged, Could copy me, and give all vengeance up. Although her marriage-day had all but come, You carried her away; but I�ll show mercy. Because you had the insolent strength of youth You carried her away; but I�ve had time To think it out through all these seven years. I will show mercy. You have many words. I will not make a bargain; I but ask What is already mine. You may go free If Deirdre will but walk into my house Before the people�s eyes, that they may know When I have put the crown upon her head [167]I have not taken her by force and guile. The doors are open, and the floors are strewed, And in the bridal chamber curtains sewn With all enchantments that give happiness, By races that are germane to the sun, And nearest him, and have no blood in their veins� For when they�re wounded the wound drips with wine� Nor speech but singing. At the bridal door Two fair king�s daughters carry in their hands The crown and robe. Oh, no! Not that, not that. Ask any other thing but that one thing. Leave me with Naisi. We will go away Into some country at the ends of the earth. We�ll trouble you no more. You will be praised By everybody if you pardon us. �He is good, he is good,� they�ll say to one another; �There�s nobody like him, for he forgave Deirdre and Naisi.� Do you think that I [168]Shall let you go again, after seven years Of longing and of planning here and there, And trafficking with merchants for the stones That make all sure, and watching my own face That none might read it? It�s better to go with him. Why should you die when one can bear it all? My life is over; it�s better to obey. Why should you die? I will not live long, Naisi. I�d not have you believe I�d long stay living; Oh no, no, no! You will go far away. You will forget me. Speak, speak, Naisi, speak, And say that it is better that I go. I will not ask it. Do not speak a word, For I will take it all upon myself. Conchubar, I will go. And do you think That, were I given life at such a price, I would not cast it from me? O, my eagle! Why do you beat vain wings upon the rock When hollow night�s above? It�s better, Naisi. [169]It may be hard for you, but you�ll forget. For what am I, to be remembered always? And there are other women. There was one, The daughter of the King of Leodas; I could not sleep because of her. Speak to him; Tell it out plain, and make him understand. And if it be he thinks I shall stay living, Say that I will not. Would I had lost life Among those Scottish kings that sought it of me, Because you were my wife, or that the worst Had taken you before this bargaining! O eagle! if you were to do this thing, And buy my life of Conchubar with your body, Love�s law being broken, I would stand alone Upon the eternal summits, and call out, And you could never come there, being banished. I would obey, but cannot. Pardon us. I know that you are good. I have heard you praised For giving gifts; and you will pardon us, Although I cannot go into your house. It was my fault. I only should be punished. The very moment these eyes fell on him, I told him; I held out my hands to him; How could he refuse? At first he would not� I am not lying�he remembered you. What do I say? My hands?�No, no, my lips� For I had pressed my lips upon his lips� I swear it is not false�my breast to his; Until I woke the passion that�s in all, And how could he resist? I had my beauty. You may have need of him, a brave, strong man, Who is not foolish at the council board, Nor does he quarrel by the candle-light And give hard blows to dogs. A cup of wine Moves him to mirth, not madness. What am I saying? You may have need of him, for you have none Who is so good a sword, or so well loved Among the common people. You may need him, And what king knows when the hour of need may come? You dream that you have men enough. You laugh. [171]Yes; you are laughing to yourself. You say, �I am Conchubar�I have no need of him.� You will cry out for him some day and say, �If Naisi were but living���[She misses NAISI.] Where is he? Where have you sent him? Where is the son of Usna? Where is he, O, where is he? The traitor who has carried off my wife No longer lives. Come to my house now, Deirdre, For he that called himself your husband�s dead. O, do not touch me. Let me go to him. King Conchubar is right. My husband�s dead. A single woman is of no account, Lacking array of servants, linen cupboards, The bacon hanging�and King Conchubar�s house [172]All ready, too�I�ll to King Conchubar�s house. It is but wisdom to do willingly What has to be. But why are you so calm? I thought that you would curse me and cry out, And fall upon the ground and tear your hair. You know too much of women to think so; Though, if I were less worthy of desire, I would pretend as much; but, being myself, It is enough that you were master here. Although we are so delicately made, There�s something brutal in us, and we are won By those who can shed blood. It was some woman That taught you how to woo: but do not touch me, For I�ll go with you and do all your will When I have done whatever�s customary. We lay the dead out, folding up the hands, Closing the eyes, and stretching out the feet, And push a pillow underneath the head, Till all�s in order; and all this I�ll do For Naisi, son of Usna.[173] It is not fitting. You are not now a wanderer, but a queen, And there are plenty that can do these things. No, no. Not yet. I cannot be your queen Till the past�s finished, and its debts are paid. When a man dies and there are debts unpaid, He wanders by the debtor�s bed and cries, There�s so much owing. You are deceiving me. You long to look upon his face again. Why should I give you now to a dead man That took you from a living? In good time. You�ll stir me to more passion than he could, And yet, if you are wise, you�ll grant me this: That I go look upon him that was once So strong and comely and held his head so high That women envied me. For I will see him [174]All blood-bedabbled and his beauty gone. It�s better, when you�re beside me in your strength, That the mind�s eye should call up the soiled body, And not the shape I loved. Look at him, women. He heard me pleading to be given up, Although my lover was still living, and yet He doubts my purpose. I will have you tell him How changeable all women are. How soon Even the best of lovers is forgot, When his day�s finished. No; but I will trust The strength you have spoken of, and not your purpose. I�ll have this gift�the first that I have asked. He has refused. There is no sap in him, Nothing but empty veins. I thought as much. He has refused me the first thing I have asked� Me, me, his wife. I understand him now; I know the sort of life I�ll have with him; [175]But he must drag me to his house by force. If he refuse [she laughs], he shall be mocked of all. They�ll say to one another, �Look at him That is so jealous that he lured a man From over sea, and murdered him, and yet He trembled at the thought of a dead face!� How do I know that you have not some knife, And go to die upon his body? Have me searched, If you would make so little of your queen. It may be that I have a knife hid here Under my dress. Bid one of these dark slaves To search me for it. Go to your farewells, queen. Now strike the wire, and sing to it awhile, Knowing that all is happy, and that you know Within what bride-bed I shall lie this night, [176]And by what man, and lie close up to him, For the bed�s narrow, and there outsleep the cockcrow. [She goes behind the curtain. They are gone, they are gone. The proud may lie by the proud. Though we were bidden to sing, cry nothing loud. They are gone, they are gone. Whispering were enough. Into the secret wilderness of their love. A high, grey cairn. What more is to be said? Eagles have gone into their cloudy bed. Where�s Naisi, son of Usna, and his queen? I and a thousand reaping-hooks and scythes Demand him of you. You have come too late. I have accomplished all. Deirdre is mine; She is my queen, and no man now can rob me. I had to climb the topmost bough and pull This apple among the winds. Open the curtain, That Fergus learn my triumph from her lips. No, no; I�ll not believe it. She is not dead� She cannot have escaped a second time! King, she is dead; but lay no hand upon her. What�s this but empty cage and tangled wire, Now the bird�s gone? but I�ll not have you touch it. You are all traitors, all against me�all. And she has deceived me for a second time. And every common man may keep his wife, But not the King.[178] I have no need of weapons, There�s not a traitor that dare stop my way. Howl, if you will; but I, being king, did right In choosing her most fitting to be queen, And letting no boy lover take the sway.
