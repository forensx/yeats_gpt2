‘Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead, [199]Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight My enemy and hope; demons for fright Jabber and scream about him in the night; For he is strong and crafty as the seas That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees. And I must needs endure and hate and weep, Until the gods and demons drop asleep, Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold.’
