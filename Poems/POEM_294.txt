While day its burden on to evening bore, With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed; Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid, And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed; In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast. Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men, Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten, Spake thus, ‘Cuchulain will dwell there and brood For three days more in dreadful quietude, And then arise, and raving slay us all. Go, cast on him delusions magical, That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.’ And ten by ten under a quicken tree, The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands Tall wands of alder and white quicken wands.
