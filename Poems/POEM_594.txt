‘Both heaven and heavenly graces do much more (Quoth he), abound in that same land then this: For there all happie peace and plenteous store Conspire in one to make contented blisse. No wayling there nor wretchednesse is heard, No bloodie issues nor no leprosies, No griesly famine, nor no raging sweard, No nightly bordrags, nor no hue and cries; The shepheards there abroad may safely lie On hills and downes, withouten dread or daunger, No ravenous wolves the good mans hope destroy, Nor outlawes fell affray the forest raunger, The learned arts do florish in great honor, And Poets wits are had in peerlesse price.’
