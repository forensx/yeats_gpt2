O Death’s old bony finger Will never find us there In the high hollow townland Where love’s to give and to spare; [219]Where boughs have fruit and blossom At all times of the year; Where rivers are running over With red beer and brown beer. An old man plays the bagpipes In a gold and silver wood; Queens, their eyes blue like the ice, Are dancing in a crowd.
