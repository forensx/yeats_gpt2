Farewell, Vijaya. Nay, no word, no word; I, priestess of this temple, offer up Prayers for the land. O Brahma, guard in sleep The merry lambs and the complacent kine, The flies below the leaves, and the young mice In the tree roots, and all the sacred flocks Of red flamingo; and my love, Vijaya; And may no restless fay with fidget finger Trouble his sleeping: give him dreams of me.
