My man is the best. And Conal’s wife And the wife of Leagerie Know that they lie When they praise their own Out of envy of me. My man is the best, First for his own sake, Being the bravest And handsomest man And the most beloved By the women of Ireland That envy me, And then for his wife’s sake Because I’m the youngest And handsomest queen.
