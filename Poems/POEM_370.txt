When one day by the shore I stood, I drew out of the numberless [190]White flowers of the foam a staff of wood From some dead warrior’s broken lance: I turned it in my hands; the stains Of war were on it, and I wept, Remembering how the Fenians stept Along the blood-bedabbled plains, Equal to good or grievous chance: Thereon young Niamh softly came And caught my hands, but spake no word Save only many times my name, In murmurs, like a frighted bird. We passed by woods, and lawns of clover, And found the horse and bridled him, For we knew well the old was over. I heard one say ‘his eyes grow dim With all the ancient sorrow of men’; And wrapped in dreams rode out again With hoofs of the pale findrinny Over the glimmering purple sea: Under the golden evening light. The immortals moved among the fountains By rivers and the woods’ old night; Some danced like shadows on the mountains, Some wandered ever hand in hand, Or sat in dreams on the pale strand; Each forehead like an obscure star Bent down above each hooked knee: And sang, and with a dreamy gaze [191]Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze Was slumbering half in the sea ways; And, as they sang, the painted birds Kept time with their bright wings and feet; Like drops of honey came their words, But fainter than a young lamb’s bleat. ‘An old man stirs the fire to a blaze, In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother; He has over-lingered his welcome; the days, Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other; He hears the storm in the chimney above, And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold, While his heart still dreams of battle and love, And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.
