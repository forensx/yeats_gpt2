Far off, most secret, and inviolate Rose, Enfold me in my hour of hours; where those ught thee at the Holy Sepulchre, the wine-vat, dwell beyond the stir mult of defeated dreams; and deep pale eyelids heavy with the sleep ve named beauty. Your great leaves enfold cient beards, the helms of ruby and gold  crowned Magi; and the king whose eyes e Pierced Hands and Rood of Elder rise id vapour and make the torches dim; ain frenzy awoke and he died; and him t Fand walking among flaming dew, rey shore where the wind never blew, st the world and Emir for a kiss; m who drove the gods out of their liss ll a hundred morns had flowered red Feasted, and wept the barrows of his dead; And the proud dreaming king who flung the crown And sorrow away, and calling bard and clown [6]Dwelt among wine-stained wanderers in deep woods; And him who sold tillage and house and goods, And sought through lands and islands numberless years Until he found with laughter and with tears A woman of so shining loveliness That men threshed corn at midnight by a tress, A little stolen tress. I too await The hour of thy great wind of love and hate. When shall the stars be blown about the sky, Like the sparks blown out of a smithy, and die? Surely thine hour has come, thy great wind blows, Far off, most secret, and inviolate Rose?
