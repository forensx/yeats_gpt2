I was going the road one day (O the brown and the yellow beer!) And I met with a man that was no right man (O my dear, my dear). ‘Give me your wife,’ said he, (O the brown and the yellow beer!) ‘Till the sun goes down and an hour of the clock’ (O my dear, my dear). ‘Good-bye, good-bye, my husband,’ (O the brown and the yellow beer!) ‘For a year and a day by the clock of the sun’ (O my dear, my dear).
