A sad, sad thought went by me slowly: Sigh, O you little stars! O, sigh and shake your blue apparel! The sad, sad thought has gone from me now wholly: Sing, O you little stars! O sing, and raise your rapturous carol To mighty Brahma, who has made you many as the sands, And laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet hands. Vijaya, I have brought my evening rice; The sun has laid his chin on the gray wood, Weary, with all his poppies gathered round him.
