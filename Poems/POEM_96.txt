And poets found, old writers say, A yew tree where his body lay; But a wild apple hid the grass With its sweet blossom where hers was; And being in good heart, because A better time had come again After the deaths of many men, And that long fighting at the ford, They wrote on tablets of thin board, Made of the apple and the yew, [61]All the love stories that they knew.
