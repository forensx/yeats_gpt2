‘Unhappie verse, the witnesse of my unhappie state, Make thy selfe fluttring winge for thy fast flying Thought, and fly forth to my love wheresoever she be. Whether lying restlesse in heavy bedde, or else Sitting so cheerlesse at the cheerful boorde, or else Playing alone carelesse on her heavenlie virginals. If in bed, tell hir that my eyes can take no rest; If at boorde tell her that my mouth can eat no meate; If at her virginals, tell her that I can heare no mirth.’
