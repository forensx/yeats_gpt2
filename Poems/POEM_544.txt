The poet, Owen Hanrahan, under a bush of may Calls down a curse on his own head because it withers grey; Then on the speckled eagle cock of Ballygawley Hill, Because it is the oldest thing that knows of cark and ill; And on the yew that has been green from the times out of mind By the Steep Place of the Strangers and the Gap of the Wind; And on the great grey pike that broods in Castle Dargan Lake Having in his long body a many a hook and ache; Then curses he old Paddy Bruen of the Well of Bride Because no hair is on his head and drowsiness inside. Then Paddy’s neighbour, Peter Hart, and Michael Gill, his friend, Because their wandering histories are never at an end. And then old Shemus Cullinan, shepherd of the Green Lands Because he holds two crutches between his crooked hands; Then calls a curse from the dark North upon old Paddy Doe, [239]Who plans to lay his withering head upon a breast of snow, Who plans to wreck a singing voice and break a merry heart, He bids a curse hang over him till breath and body part; But he calls down a blessing on the blossom of the may, Because it comes in beauty, and in beauty blows away.
