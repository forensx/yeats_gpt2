Caolte, and Conan, and Finn were there, [176]When we followed a deer with our baying hounds, With Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair, And passing the Firbolgs’ burial mounds, Came to the cairn-heaped grassy hill Where passionate Maeve is stony still; And found on the dove-gray edge of the sea A pearl-pale, high-born lady, who rode On a horse with bridle of findrinny; And like a sunset were her lips, A stormy sunset on doomed ships; A citron colour gloomed in her hair, But down to her feet white vesture flowed, And with the glimmering crimson glowed Of many a figured embroidery; And it was bound with a pearl-pale shell That wavered like the summer streams, As her soft bosom rose and fell. You are still wrecked among heathen dreams.
