‘Penelope: Alas! what cries! Say, is the prince still safe? The Maid: He shieldeth himself well, and striketh surely; His foes fall down before him. Ah! now what can I see? Who cometh? Lo! a dazzling helm, a spear Of silver or electron; share and swift The piercings. How they fall! Ha! shields are raised In vain. I am blinded, or the beggar-man [246]Hath waxed in strength. He is changed, he is young. O strange! He is all in golden armour. These are gods That slay the suitors. (Runs to Penelope.) O lady, forgive me. ’Tis Ares’ self. I saw his crispèd beard; I saw beneath his helm his curlèd locks.’
