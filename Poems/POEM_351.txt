‘O Oisin, mount by me and ride To shores by the wash of the tremulous tide, Where men have heaped no burial mounds, And the days pass by like a wayward tune, [179]Where broken faith has never been known, And the blushes of first love never have flown; And there I will give you a hundred hounds; No mightier creatures bay at the moon; And a hundred robes of murmuring silk, And a hundred calves and a hundred sheep Whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows, And a hundred spears and a hundred bows, And oil and wine and honey and milk, And always never-anxious sleep; While a hundred youths, mighty of limb, But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife, And a hundred maidens, merry as birds, Who when they dance to a fitful measure Have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds, Shall follow your horn and obey your whim, And you shall know the Danaan leisure: And Niamh be with you for a wife.’ Then she sighed gently, ‘It grows late, Music and love and sleep await, Where I would be when the white moon climbs, The red sun falls, and the world grows dim.’
