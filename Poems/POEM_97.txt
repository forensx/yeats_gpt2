Let rush and bird cry out their fill Of the harper’s daughter if they will, Beloved, I am not afraid of her. She is not wiser nor lovelier, And you are more high of heart than she, For all her wanderings over-sea; But I’d have bird and rush forget Those other two; for never yet Has lover lived, but longed to wive Like them that are no more alive.
