But no, for they have always been my friends; And though they love to blow a smoking coal Till it’s all flame, the wars they blow aflame Are full of glory, and heart-uplifting pride, And not like this. The wars they love awaken Old fingers and the sleepy strings of harps. Who did it, then? Are you afraid? Speak out! For I have put you under my protection, [121]And will reward you well. Dubthach the Chafer? He’d an old grudge. No, for he is with Maeve. Laegaire did it! Why do you not speak? What is this house? [Pause.] Now I remember all.
