I sang how, when day’s toil is done, Orchil shakes out her long dark hair That hides away the dying sun And sheds faint odours through the air: When my hand passed from wire to wire [112]It quenched, with sound like falling dew, The whirling and the wandering fire; But lift a mournful ulalu, For the kind wires are torn and still, And I must wander wood and hill Through summer’s heat and winter’s cold. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
