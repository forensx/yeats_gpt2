That runner said: ‘I am from the south; I run to Baile Honey-Mouth, To tell him how the girl Aillinn Rode from the country of her kin, And old and young men rode with her: For all that country had been astir If anybody half as fair Had chosen a husband anywhere But where it could see her every day. When they had ridden a little way An old man caught the horse’s head With: “You must home again, and wed With somebody in your own land.” A young man cried and kissed her hand, “O lady, wed with one of us”; And when no face grew piteous For any gentle thing she spake, She fell and died of the heart-break.’
