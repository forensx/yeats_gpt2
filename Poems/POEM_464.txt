May this fire have driven out The shape-changers that can put Ruin on a great king’s house Until all be ruinous. Names whereby a man has known The threshold and the hearthstone, Gather on the wind and drive The women, none can kiss and thrive, For they are but whirling wind, Out of memory and mind. They would make a prince decay With light images of clay, Planted in the running wave; Or, for many shapes they have, They would change them into hounds, Until he had died of his wounds, Though the change were but a whim; Or they’d hurl a spell at him, [97]That he follow with desire Bodies that can never tire, Or grow kind, for they anoint All their bodies, joint by joint, With a miracle-working juice That is made out of the grease Of the ungoverned unicorn. But the man is thrice forlorn, Emptied, ruined, wracked, and lost, That they follow, for at most They will give him kiss for kiss; While they murmur, ‘After this Hatred may be sweet to the taste.’ Those wild hands that have embraced All his body can but shove At the burning wheel of love, Till the side of hate comes up. Therefore in this ancient cup May the sword-blades drink their fill Of the homebrew there, until They will have for masters none But the threshold and hearthstone. I’ll take and keep this oath, and from this day [98]I shall be what you please, my chicks, my nestlings. Yet I had thought you were of those that praised Whatever life could make the pulse run quickly, Even though it were brief, and that you held That a free gift was better than a forced.— But that’s all over.—I will keep it, too. I never gave a gift and took it again. If the wild horse should break the chariot-pole, It would be punished. Should that be in the oath?
