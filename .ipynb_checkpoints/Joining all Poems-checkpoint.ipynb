       "['The host is riding from Knocknarea And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare; Caolte tossing his burning hair And Niamh calling Away, come away: Empty your heart of its mortal dream. The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round, Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound, Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam, Our arms are waving, our lips are apart; And if any gaze on our rushing band, We come between him and the deed of his hand, We come between him and the hope of his heart. The host is rushing ’twixt night and day, And where is there hope or deed as fair? Caolte tossing his burning hair, And Niamh calling Away, come away.',\n",

O she had not these ways, When all the wild summer was in her gaze. O heart! O heart! if she’d but turn her head, You’d know the folly of being comforted.',\n",
       " 'I thought to fly to her when the end of day Awakens an old memory, and say, ‘Your strength, that is so lofty and fierce and kind, It might call up a new age, calling to mind The queens that were imagined long ago, Is but half yours: he kneaded in the dough Through the long years of youth, and who would have thought It all, and more than it all, would come to naught, And that dear words meant nothing?’ But enough, For when we have blamed the wind we can blame love; Or, if there needs be more, be nothing said That would be harsh for children that have strayed.',\n",
       " 'Never give all the heart, for love Will hardly seem worth thinking of To passionate women if it seem Certain, and they never dream That it fades out from kiss to kiss; For everything that’s lovely is But a brief dreamy kind delight. O never give the heart outright, For they, for all smooth lips can say, Have given their hearts up to the play. And who could play it well enough If deaf and dumb and blind with love? He that made this knows all the cost, For he gave all his heart and lost.',\n",
       " 'I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds, ‘Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will, I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words, For the roads are unending, and there is no place to my mind.’ The honey-pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill, And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams. No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.',\n",

No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.',\n",
       " 'I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round Coupled with golden chains, and sing as they fly. A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by; I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams. No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.',\n",

       " 'I said: ‘A line will take us hours maybe; Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought, Our stitching and unstitching has been naught. Better go down upon your marrow bones And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather; For to articulate sweet sounds together Is to work harder than all these, and yet Be thought an idler by the noisy set Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen The martyrs call the world.’',\n",

       " 'I said: ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring. There have been lovers who thought love should be So much compounded of high courtesy That they would sigh and quote with learned looks Precedents out of beautiful old books; Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.’',\n",
       " 'We sat grown quiet at the name of love; We saw the last embers of daylight die, And in the trembling blue-green of the sky A moon, worn as if it had been a shell Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell About the stars and broke in days and years.',\n",
       " 'I had a thought for no one’s but your ears; That you were beautiful, and that I strove To love you in the old high way of love; That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown As weary hearted as that hollow moon.',\n",
       " 'The old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand, Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand; Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies, But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.',\n",
       " 'The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea, And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say. Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat; But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet [75]Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.',\n",
       " 'The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare, For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air; Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood; But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.',\n",
       " 'I heard the old, old men say, ‘Everything alters, And one by one we drop away.’ They had hands like claws, and their knees Were twisted like the old thorn trees By the waters. I heard the old, old men say, ‘All that’s beautiful drifts away Like the waters.’',\n",
       " 'I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde, Nor Avalon the grass-green hollow, nor Joyous Isle, Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while; Nor Ulad, when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind, Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart; Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon’s light and the sun’s Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long-lived ones; Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart, And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn, To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier: Therein are many queens like Branwen and Guinivere; [77]And Niamh and Laban and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn, And the wood-woman, whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk; And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore, Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar, I hear the harp-string praise them, or hear their mournful talk. Because of a story I heard under the thin horn Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day, To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay, Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.',\n",
       " 'O hurry to the water amid the trees, For there the tall deer and his leman sigh When they have but looked upon their images, O that none ever loved but you and I!',\n",
       " 'The bread and the wine had a doom, For these were the host of the air; He sat and played in a dream Of her long dim hair.',\n",
       " 'Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed, Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky, When the sun looked out of his golden hood, O that none ever loved but you and I!',\n",
       " 'O hurry to the hollow wood, for there I will drive out the deer and moon and cry— O my share of the world, O yellow hair, No one has ever loved but you and I!',\n",
       " 'Sweetheart, do not love too long: I loved long and long, And grew to be out of fashion Like an old song.',\n",
       " 'All through the years of our youth Neither could have known Their own thought from the other’s, We were so much at one.',\n",

       " 'Hurry to bless the hands that play, The mouths that speak, the notes and strings, O masters of the glittering town! O! lay the shrilly trumpet down, Though drunken with the flags that sway Over the ramparts and the towers, And with the waving of your wings.',\n",
       " 'Maybe they linger by the way. One gathers up his purple gown; One leans and mutters by the wall— He dreads the weight of mortal hours.',\n",
       " 'O no, O no! they hurry down Like plovers that have heard the call.[81]',\n",
       " 'O kinsmen of the Three in One, O kinsmen bless the hands that play. The notes they waken shall live on When all this heavy history’s done; Our hands, our hands must ebb away.',\n",

An old man plays the bagpipes In a golden and silver wood; Queens, their eyes blue like the ice, Are dancing in a crowd.',\n",

       " 'Michael will unhook his trumpet From a bough overhead, And blow a little noise When the supper has been spread. Gabriel will come from the water [84]With a fish tail, and talk Of wonders that have happened On wet roads where men walk, And lift up an old horn Of hammered silver, and drink Till he has fallen asleep Upon the starry brink.',\n",

       " 'While I wrought out these fitful Danaan rhymes, My heart would brim with dreams about the times When we bent down above the fading coals; And talked of the dark folk, who live in souls Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees; And of the wayward twilight companies, Who sigh with mingled sorrow and content, [90]Because their blossoming dreams have never bent Under the fruit of evil and of good; And of the embattled flaming multitude Who rise, wing above wing, flame above flame, And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name, And with the clashing of their sword blades make A rapturous music, till the morning break, And the white hush end all, but the loud beat Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet.',\n",
       " 'The woods of Arcady are dead, And over is their antique joy; Of old the world on dreaming fed; Gray Truth is now her painted toy; Yet still she turns her restless head: But O, sick children of the world, Of all the many changing things In dreary dancing past us whirled, To the cracked tune that Chronos sings, Words alone are certain good. Where are now the warring kings, Word bemockers?—By the Rood Where are now the warring kings? An idle word is now their glory, By the stammering schoolboy said, Reading some entangled story: The kings of the old time are fled. The wandering earth herself may be Only a sudden flaming word, In clanging space a moment heard, [92]Troubling the endless reverie. Then no wise worship dusty deeds, Nor seek—for this is also sooth— To hunger fiercely after truth, Lest all thy toiling only breeds New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then, No learning from the starry men, Who follow with the optic glass The whirling ways of stars that pass; Seek, then—for this is also sooth— No word of theirs: the cold star-bane Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain, And dead is all their human truth. Go, gather by the humming sea Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell, And to its lips thy story tell, And they thy comforters will be, Rewording in melodious guile Thy fretful words a little while, Till they shall singing fade in ruth, And die a pearly brotherhood; For words alone are certain good: [93]Sing, then, for this is also sooth. I must be gone: there is a grave Where daffodil and lily wave, And I would please the hapless faun, Buried under the sleepy ground, With mirthful songs before the dawn. His shouting days with mirth were crowned; And still I dream he treads the lawn, Walking ghostly in the dew, Pierced by my glad singing through, My songs of old earth’s dreamy youth: But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou! For fair are poppies on the brow: Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.',\n",
       " 'There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend, And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming, Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming And humming sands, where windy surges wend: And he called loudly to the stars to bend From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they Among themselves laugh on and sing alway: And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story! The sea swept on and cried her old cry still, Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill; He fled the persecution of her glory [95]And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping, Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening, But naught they heard, for they are always listening, The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping. And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend, Sought once again the shore, and found a shell And thought, I will my heavy story tell Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; And my own tale again for me shall sing, And my own whispering words be comforting, And lo! my ancient burden may depart. Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim; But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.',\n",

O sing, and raise your rapturous carol To mighty Brahma, who has made you many as the sands, And laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet hands. Vijaya, I have brought my evening rice; The sun has laid his chin on the gray wood, Weary, with all his poppies gathered round him.',\n",

I told you so. Now cuff him off. He’s off! A kiss for you, Because you saved my rice. Have you no thanks?',\n",

The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from his eye. I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk: Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk, [104]For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide. A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes Brimful of starlight, and he said: The Stamper of the Skies, He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me? I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say: Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay, He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light.',\n",

For all things turn to barrenness In the dim glass the demons hold, The glass of outer weariness, Made when God slept in times of old. There, through the broken branches, go The ravens of unresting thought; Peering and flying to and fro, To see men’s souls bartered and bought. When they are heard upon the wind, And when they shake their wings; alas! Thy tender eyes grow all unkind: Gaze no more in the bitter glass.',\n",

But now a wandering land breeze came And a far sound of feathery quires; It seemed to blow from the dying flame, They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.

And once a maiden by my side Gave me a harp, and bid me sing, And touch the laughing silver string; But when I sang of human joy A sorrow wrapped each merry face, And, Patric! by your beard, they wept, Until one came, a tearful boy; ‘A sadder creature never stept [185]Than this strange human bard,’ he cried; And caught the silver harp away, And, weeping over the white strings, hurled It down in a leaf-hid hollow place That kept dim waters from the sky; And each one said with a long, long sigh, ‘O saddest harp in all the world, Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!’',\n",

We passed by woods, and lawns of clover, And found the horse and bridled him, For we knew well the old was over. I heard one say ‘his eyes grow dim With all the ancient sorrow of men’; And wrapped in dreams rode out again With hoofs of the pale findrinny Over the glimmering purple sea: Under the golden evening light. The immortals moved among the fountains By rivers and the woods’ old night; Some danced like shadows on the mountains, Some wandered ever hand in hand, Or sat in dreams on the pale strand; Each forehead like an obscure star Bent down above each hooked knee: And sang, and with a dreamy gaze [191]Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze Was slumbering half in the sea ways; And, as they sang, the painted birds Kept time with their bright wings and feet; Like drops of honey came their words, But fainter than a young lamb’s bleat. ‘An old man stirs the fire to a blaze, In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother; He has over-lingered his welcome; the days, Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other; He hears the storm in the chimney above, And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold, While his heart still dreams of battle and love, And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.',\n",

I owe you all obedience, and yet How can I give it, when the man I have loved More than all others, thinks that he is wronged So bitterly, that he will starve and die Rather than bear it? Is there any man Will throw his life away for a light issue? It is but fitting that you take his side Until you understand how light an issue Has put us by the ears. Three days ago I yielded to the outcry of my courtiers— Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law— Who long had thought it against their dignity For a mere man of words to sit amongst them At my own table. When the meal was spread, I ordered Seanchan to a lower table; And when he pleaded for the poets’ right, Established at the establishment of the world, I said that I was King, and that all rights Had their original fountain in some king, And that it was the men who ruled the world, [10]And not the men who sang to it, who should sit Where there was the most honour. My courtiers— Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law— Shouted approval; and amid that noise Seanchan went out, and from that hour to this, Although there is good food and drink beside him, Has eaten nothing. I can breathe again. You have taken a great burden from my mind, For that old custom’s not worth dying for. Persuade him to eat or drink. Till yesterday I thought that hunger and weakness had been enough; But finding them too trifling and too light To hold his mouth from biting at the grave, I called you hither, and all my hope’s in you, And certain of his neighbours and good friends That I have sent for. While he is lying there Perishing, my good name in the world Is perishing also. I cannot give way, [11]Because I am King. Because if I gave way, My Nobles would call me a weakling, and it may be The very throne be shaken. I will persuade him. Your words had been enough persuasion, King; But being lost in sleep or reverie, He cannot hear them. Make him eat or drink. Nor is it all because of my good name I’d have him do it, for he is a man That might well hit the fancy of a king, Banished out of his country, or a woman’s, Or any other’s that can judge a man For what he is. But I that sit a throne, And take my measure from the needs of the State, Call his wild thought that overruns the measure, Making words more than deeds, and his proud will That would unsettle all, most mischievous, And he himself a most mischievous man. [12]Promise a house with grass and tillage land, An annual payment, jewels and silken ware, Or anything but that old right of the poets. The King did wrong to abrogate our right; But Seanchan, who talks of dying for it, Talks foolishly. Look at us, Seanchan; Waken out of your dream and look at us, Who have ridden under the moon and all the day, Until the moon has all but come again, That we might be beside you. I was but now In Almhuin, in a great high-raftered house, With Finn and Osgar. Odours of roast flesh Rose round me, and I saw the roasting-spits; And then the dream was broken, and I saw Grania dividing salmon by a stream. Hunger has made you dream of roasting flesh; [13]And though I all but weep to think of it, The hunger of the crane, that starves himself At the full moon because he is afraid Of his own shadow and the glittering water, Seems to me little more fantastical Than this of yours. Why, that’s the very truth. It is as though the moon changed everything— Myself and all that I can hear and see; For when the heavy body has grown weak, There’s nothing that can tether the wild mind That, being moonstruck and fantastical, Goes where it fancies. I had even thought I knew your voice and face, but now the words Are so unlikely that I needs must ask Who is it that bids me put my hunger by. I am your oldest pupil, Seanchan; The one that has been with you many years— So many, that you said at Candlemas That I had almost done with school, and knew All but all that poets understand. [14]My oldest pupil? No, that cannot be, For it is some one of the courtly crowds That have been round about me from sunrise, And I am tricked by dreams; but I’ll refute them. At Candlemas I bid that pupil tell me Why poetry is honoured, wishing to know If he had any weighty argument For distant countries and strange, churlish kings. What did he answer? I said the poets hung Images of the life that was in Eden About the child-bed of the world, that it, Looking upon those images, might bear Triumphant children. But why must I stand here, Repeating an old lesson, while you starve? Tell on, for I begin to know the voice. What evil thing will come upon the world If the Arts perish? If the Arts should perish, [15]The world that lacked them would be like a woman, That looking on the cloven lips of a hare, Brings forth a hare-lipped child. But that’s not all: For when I asked you how a man should guard Those images, you had an answer also, If you’re the man that you have claimed to be, Comparing them to venerable things God gave to men before he gave them wheat. I answered—and the word was half your own— That he should guard them as the Men of Dea Guard their four treasures, as the Grail King guards His holy cup, or the pale, righteous horse The jewel that is underneath his horn, Pouring out life for it as one pours out Sweet heady wine.... But now I understand; You would refute me out of my own mouth; And yet a place at table, near the King, Is nothing of great moment, Seanchan. How does so light a thing touch poetry?',\n",
       " 'At Candlemas you called this poetry One of the fragile, mighty things of God, That die at an insult. Give me some true answer, For on that day we spoke about the Court, And said that all that was insulted there The world insulted, for the Courtly life, Being the first comely child of the world, Is the world’s model. How shall I answer him? Can you not give me some true argument? I will not tempt him with a lying one. O, tell him that the lovers of his music Have need of him. But I am labouring For some that shall be born in the nick o’ time, And find sweet nurture, that they may have voices, [17]Even in anger, like the strings of harps; And how could they be born to majesty If I had never made the golden cradle? Why did you take me from my father’s fields? If you would leave me now, what shall I love? Where shall I go? What shall I set my hand to? And why have you put music in my ears, If you would send me to the clattering houses? I will throw down the trumpet and the harp, For how could I sing verses or make music With none to praise me, and a broken heart? What was it that the poets promised you, If it was not their sorrow? Do not speak. Have I not opened school on these bare steps, And are not you the youngest of my scholars? And I would have all know that when all falls In ruin, poetry calls out in joy, Being the scattering hand, the bursting pod, The victim’s joy among the holy flame, God’s laughter at the shattering of the world. And now that joy laughs out, and weeps and burns On these bare steps.[18] O master, do not die! Trouble him with no useless argument. Be silent! There is nothing we can do Except find out the King and kneel to him, And beg our ancient right. For here are some To say whatever we could say and more, And fare as badly. Come, boy, that is no use. If it seem well that we beseech the King, Lay down your harps and trumpets on the stones In silence, and come with me silently. Come with slow footfalls, and bow all your heads, For a bowed head becomes a mourner best. ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land,’ Those are the words I have to keep in mind— ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land.’ I have the words. They are all upon the Ogham. ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land.’ But what’s their order? The King were rightly served If Seanchan drove his good luck away. What’s there about a king, that’s in the world From birth to burial like another man, That he should change old customs, that were in it As long as ever the world has been a world?[20] If I were king I would not meddle with him, For there is something queer about a poet. I knew of one that would be making rhyme Under a thorn at crossing of three roads. He was as ragged as ourselves, and yet He was no sooner dead than every thorn tree From Inchy to Kiltartan withered away. The King is but a fool! I am getting ready. A poet has power from beyond the world, That he may set our thoughts upon old times, And lucky queens and little holy fish That rise up every seventh year—— Hush! hush! To cure the crippled.[21] I am half ready now. There’s not a mischief I’d begrudge the King If it were any other—— Hush! I am ready. That died to get it. I have brought out the food, And if my master will not eat of it, I’ll home and get provision for his wake, For that’s no great way off. Well, have your say, But don’t be long about it. Chief Poet of Ireland, I am the Mayor of your own town Kinvara, And I am come to tell you that the news Of this great trouble with the King of Gort [22]Has plunged us in deep sorrow—part for you, Our honoured townsman, part for our good town. But what comes now? Something about the King. Get on! get on! The food is all set out. Don’t hurry me. Give us a taste of it. He’ll not begrudge it. Let them that have their limbs Starve if they will. We have to keep in mind The stomach God has left us. Hush! I have it! The King was said to be most friendly to us, [23]And we have reason, as you’ll recollect, For thinking that he was about to give Those grazing lands inland we so much need, Being pinched between the water and the stones. Our mowers mow with knives between the stones; The sea washes the meadows. You know well We have asked nothing but what’s reasonable. Reason in plenty. Yellowy white hair, A hollow face, and not too many teeth. How comes it he has been so long in the world And not found Reason out? What good is there In telling him what he has heard all day! I will set food before him. [24]Don’t hurry me! It’s small respect you’re showing to the town! Get farther off! [To SEANCHAN.] We would not have you think, Weighty as these considerations are, That they have been as weighty in our minds As our desire that one we take much pride in, A man that’s been an honour to our town, Should live and prosper; therefore we beseech you To give way in a matter of no moment, A matter of mere sentiment—a trifle— That we may always keep our pride in you. Master, master, eat this! It’s not king’s food, That’s cooked for everybody and nobody. Here’s barley-bread out of your father’s oven, And dulse from Duras. Here is the dulse, your honour; It’s wholesome, and has the good taste of the sea. He has taken it, and there’ll be nothing left! Nothing at all; he wanted his own sort. What’s honey to a cat, corn to a dog, Or a green apple to a ghost in a churchyard? Eat it yourself, for you have come a journey, And it may be eat nothing on the way. How could I eat it, and your honour starving! It is your father sends it, and he cried Because the stiffness that is in his bones Prevented him from coming, and bid me tell you That he is old, that he has need of you, And that the people will be pointing at him, And he not able to lift up his head, If you should turn the King’s favour away; And he adds to it, that he cared you well, And you in your young age, and that it’s right That you should care him now.[26] And is that all? What did my mother say? She gave no message; For when they told her you had it in mind to starve, Or get again the ancient right of the poets, She said: ‘No message can do any good. He will not send the answer that you want. We cannot change him.’ And she went indoors, Lay down upon the bed, and turned her face Out of the light. And thereupon your father Said: ‘Tell him that his mother sends no message, Albeit broken down and miserable.’      [A pause. Here’s a pigeon’s egg from Duras, and these others Were laid by your own hens. She has sent no message. [27]Our mothers know us; they know us to the bone. They knew us before birth, and that is why They know us even better than the sweethearts Upon whose breasts we have lain. Go quickly! Go And tell them that my mother was in the right. There is no answer. Go and tell them that. Go tell them that she knew me. What is he saying? I never understood a poet’s talk More than the baa of a sheep! You have not heard, It may be, having been so much away, How many of the cattle died last winter From lacking grass, and that there was much sickness Because the poor have nothing but salt fish To live on through the winter? Get away, And leave the place to me! It’s my turn now, For your sack’s empty![28] Is it ‘get away’! Is that the way I’m to be spoken to! Am I not Mayor? Amn’t I authority? Amn’t I in the King’s place? Answer me that! Then show the people what a king is like: Pull down old merings and root custom up, Whitewash the dunghills, fatten hogs and geese, Hang your gold chain about an ass’s neck, And burn the blessed thorn trees out of the fields, And drive what’s comely away! Holy Saint Coleman! Fine talk! fine talk! What else does the King do? He fattens hogs and drives the poet away! He starves the song-maker![29]',\n",

And I must be your man, well-nigh your bondsman, Because a youngster out of Aoife’s country Has found the shore ill-guarded. He came to land While you were somewhere out of sight and hearing, Hunting or dancing with your wild companions. [86]He can be driven out. I’ll not be bound. I’ll dance or hunt, or quarrel or make love, Wherever and whenever I’ve a mind to. If time had not put water in your blood, You never would have thought it. I would leave A strong and settled country to my children. And I must be obedient in all things; Give up my will to yours; go where you please; Come when you call; sit at the council-board Among the unshapely bodies of old men. I whose mere name has kept this country safe, I that in early days have driven out Maeve of Cruachan and the northern pirates, The hundred kings of Sorcha, and the kings Out of the Garden in the East of the World. Must I, that held you on the throne when all Had pulled you from it, swear obedience As if I were some cattle-raising king? Are my shins speckled with the heat of the fire, Or have my hands no skill but to make figures Upon the ashes with a stick? Am I So slack and idle that I need a whip Before I serve you?[87] No, no whip, Cuchulain, But every day my children come and say: ‘This man is growing harder to endure. How can we be at safety with this man That nobody can buy or bid or bind? We shall be at his mercy when you are gone; He burns the earth as if he were a fire, And time can never touch him.’ And so the tale Grows finer yet; and I am to obey Whatever child you set upon the throne, As if it were yourself! Most certainly. I am High King, my son shall be High King; And you for all the wildness of your blood, And though your father came out of the sun, Are but a little king and weigh but light In anything that touches government, If put into the balance with my children. [88]It’s well that we should speak our minds out plainly, For when we die we shall be spoken of In many countries. We in our young days Have seen the heavens like a burning cloud Brooding upon the world, and being more Than men can be now that cloud’s lifted up, We should be the more truthful. Conchubar, I do not like your children—they have no pith, No marrow in their bones, and will lie soft Where you and I lie hard. You rail at them Because you have no children of your own. I think myself most lucky that I leave No pallid ghost or mockery of a man To drift and mutter in the corridors, Where I have laughed and sung. That is not true, For all your boasting of the truth between us; For, there is no man having house and lands, That have been in the one family And called by the one name for centuries, But is made miserable if he know They are to pass into a stranger’s keeping, As yours will pass.[89] The most of men feel that, But you and I leave names upon the harp. You play with arguments as lawyers do, And put no heart in them. I know your thoughts, For we have slept under the one cloak and drunk From the one wine cup. I know you to the bone. I have heard you cry, aye in your very sleep, ‘I have no son,’ and with such bitterness That I have gone upon my knees and prayed That it might be amended. For you thought That I should be as biddable as others Had I their reason for it; but that’s not true, For I would need a weightier argument Than one that marred me in the copying, As I have that clean hawk out of the air That, as men say, begot this body of mine Upon a mortal woman. Now as ever You mock at every reasonable hope, And would have nothing, or impossible things. What eye has ever looked upon the child Would satisfy a mind like that?[90] I would leave My house and name to none that would not face Even myself in battle. Being swift of foot, And making light of every common chance, You should have overtaken on the hills Some daughter of the air, or on the shore A daughter of the Country-under-Wave. I am not blasphemous. Yet you despise Our queens, and would not call a child your own, If one of them had borne him. I have not said it. Ah! I remember I have heard you boast, [91]When the ale was in your blood, that there was one In Scotland, where you had learnt the trade of war, That had a stone-pale cheek and red-brown hair. And that although you had loved other women, You’d sooner that fierce woman of the camp Bore you a son than any queen among them. You call her a ‘fierce woman of the camp,’ For having lived among the spinning-wheels, You’d have no woman near that would not say, ‘Ah! how wise!’ ‘What will you have for supper?’ ‘What shall I wear that I may please you, sir?’ And keep that humming through the day and night Forever. A fierce woman of the camp! But I am getting angry about nothing. You have never seen her. Ah! Conchubar, had you seen her With that high, laughing, turbulent head of hers Thrown backward, and the bow-string at her ear, Or sitting at the fire with those grave eyes Full of good counsel as it were with wine, Or when love ran through all the lineaments [92]Of her wild body—although she had no child, None other had all beauty, queen, or lover, Or was so fitted to give birth to kings. There’s nothing I can say but drifts you farther From the one weighty matter. That very woman— For I know well that you are praising Aoife— Now hates you and will leave no subtilty Unknotted that might run into a noose About your throat, no army in idleness That might bring ruin on this land you serve. No wonder in that, no wonder at all in that. I never have known love but as a kiss In the mid-battle, and a difficult truce Of oil and water, candles and dark night, Hillside and hollow, the hot-footed sun, And the cold, sliding, slippery-footed moon— A brief forgiveness between opposites That have been hatreds for three times the age Of this long-’stablished ground. Listen to me. [93]Aoife makes war on us, and every day Our enemies grow greater and beat the walls More bitterly, and you within the walls Are every day more turbulent; and yet, When I would speak about these things, your fancy Runs as it were a swallow on the wind.',\n",
       " 'Look at the door and what men gather there— Old counsellors that steer the land with me, And younger kings, the dancers and harp-players That follow in your tumults, and all these Are held there by the one anxiety. Will you be bound into obedience And so make this land safe for them and theirs? You are but half a king and I but half; I need your might of hand and burning heart, And you my wisdom. Nestlings of a high nest, [94]Hawks that have followed me into the air And looked upon the sun, we’ll out of this And sail upon the wind once more. This king Would have me take an oath to do his will, And having listened to his tune from morning, I will no more of it. Run to the stable And set the horses to the chariot-pole, And send a messenger to the harp-players. We’ll find a level place among the woods, And dance awhile. Cuchulain, take the oath. There is none here that would not have you take it. You’d have me take it? Are you of one mind? All, all, all, all! Do what the High King bids you. There is not one but dreads this turbulence Now that they’re settled men.[95] Are you so changed, Or have I grown more dangerous of late? But that’s not it. I understand it all. It’s you that have changed. You’ve wives and children now, And for that reason cannot follow one That lives like a bird’s flight from tree to tree.— It’s time the years put water in my blood And drowned the wildness of it, for all’s changed, But that unchanged.—I’ll take what oath you will: The moon, the sun, the water, light, or air, I do not care how binding. On this fire That has been lighted from your hearth and mine; The older men shall be my witnesses, The younger, yours. The holders of the fire Shall purify the thresholds of the house With waving fire, and shut the outer door, According to the custom; and sing rhyme That has come down from the old law-makers To blow the witches out. Considering That the wild will of man could be oath-bound, [96]But that a woman’s could not, they bid us sing Against the will of woman at its wildest In the shape-changers that run upon the wind.',\n",
       " 'May this fire have driven out The shape-changers that can put Ruin on a great king’s house Until all be ruinous. Names whereby a man has known The threshold and the hearthstone, Gather on the wind and drive The women, none can kiss and thrive, For they are but whirling wind, Out of memory and mind. They would make a prince decay With light images of clay, Planted in the running wave; Or, for many shapes they have, They would change them into hounds, Until he had died of his wounds, Though the change were but a whim; Or they’d hurl a spell at him, [97]That he follow with desire Bodies that can never tire, Or grow kind, for they anoint All their bodies, joint by joint, With a miracle-working juice That is made out of the grease Of the ungoverned unicorn. But the man is thrice forlorn, Emptied, ruined, wracked, and lost, That they follow, for at most They will give him kiss for kiss; While they murmur, ‘After this Hatred may be sweet to the taste.’ Those wild hands that have embraced All his body can but shove At the burning wheel of love, Till the side of hate comes up. Therefore in this ancient cup May the sword-blades drink their fill Of the homebrew there, until They will have for masters none But the threshold and hearthstone. I’ll take and keep this oath, and from this day [98]I shall be what you please, my chicks, my nestlings. Yet I had thought you were of those that praised Whatever life could make the pulse run quickly, Even though it were brief, and that you held That a free gift was better than a forced.— But that’s all over.—I will keep it, too. I never gave a gift and took it again. If the wild horse should break the chariot-pole, It would be punished. Should that be in the oath?',\n",

And are you noble? for if of common seed, You cannot weigh your sword against his sword But in mixed battle. I am under bonds To tell my name to no man; but it’s noble. But I would know your name and not your bonds. You cannot speak in the Assembly House, If you are not noble. Answer the High King! I will give no other proof than the hawk gives— That it’s no sparrow! Yet look upon me, kings. I, too, am of that ancient seed, and carry The signs about this body and in these bones.[101] To have shown the hawk’s grey feather is enough, And you speak highly, too. Give me that helmet. I’d thought they had grown weary sending champions. That sword and belt will do. This fighting’s welcome. The High King there has promised me his wisdom; But the hawk’s sleepy till its well-beloved Cries out amid the acorns, or it has seen Its enemy like a speck upon the sun. What’s wisdom to the hawk, when that clear eye Is burning nearer up in the high air? Hither into the light. The very tint Of her that I was speaking of but now. Not a pin’s difference. You are from the North Where there are many that have that tint of hair— [102]Red-brown, the light red-brown. Come nearer, boy, For I would have another look at you. There’s more likeness—a pale, a stone-pale cheek. What brought you, boy? Have you no fear of death? Whether I live or die is in the gods’ hands. That is all words, all words; a young man’s talk. I am their plough, their harrow, their very strength; For he that’s in the sun begot this body Upon a mortal woman, and I have heard tell It seemed as if he had outrun the moon; That he must follow always through waste heaven, He loved so happily. He’ll be but slow To break a tree that was so sweetly planted. Let’s see that arm. I’ll see it if I choose. That arm had a good father and a good mother, But it is not like this. You are mocking me; You think I am not worthy to be fought. But I’ll not wrangle but with this talkative knife.[103] Put up your sword; I am not mocking you. I’d have you for my friend, but if it’s not Because you have a hot heart and a cold eye, I cannot tell the reason. [To CONCHUBAR.] He has got her fierceness, And nobody is as fierce as those pale women. But I will keep him with me, Conchubar, That he may set my memory upon her When the day’s fading.—You will stop with us, And we will hunt the deer and the wild bulls; And, when we have grown weary, light our fires Between the wood and water, or on some mountain Where the shape-changers of the morning come. The High King there would make a mock of me Because I did not take a wife among them. Why do you hang your head? It’s a good life: The head grows prouder in the light of the dawn, And friendship thickens in the murmuring dark Where the spare hazels meet the wool-white foam. But I can see there’s no more need for words And that you’ll be my friend from this day out.[104] He has come hither not in his own name But in Queen Aoife’s, and has challenged us In challenging the foremost man of us all. Well, well, what matter? You think it does not matter; And that a fancy lighter than the air, A whim of the moment has more matter in it. For having none that shall reign after you, You cannot think as I do, who would leave A throne too high for insult. Let your children Re-mortar their inheritance, as we have, And put more muscle on.—I’ll give you gifts, But I’d have something too—that arm-ring, boy. We’ll have this quarrel out when you are older. There is no man I’d sooner have my friend [105]Than you, whose name has gone about the world As if it had been the wind; but Aoife’d say I had turned coward. I will give you gifts That Aoife’ll know, and all her people know, To have come from me.       [Showing cloak. My father gave me this. He came to try me, rising up at dawn Out of the cold dark of the rich sea. He challenged me to battle, but before My sword had touched his sword, told me his name, Gave me this cloak, and vanished. It was woven By women of the Country-under-Wave Out of the fleeces of the sea. O! tell her I was afraid, or tell her what you will. No; tell her that I heard a raven croak On the north side of the house, and was afraid. Some witch of the air has troubled Cuchulain’s mind. No witchcraft. His head is like a woman’s head I had a fancy for.[106] A witch of the air Can make a leaf confound us with memories. They run upon the wind and hurl the spells That make us nothing, out of the invisible wind. They have gone to school to learn the trick of it. No, no—there’s nothing out of common here; The winds are innocent.—That arm-ring, boy. If I’ve your leave I’ll take this challenge up. No, give it me, High King, for this wild Aoife Has carried off my slaves. No, give it me, For she has harried me in house and herd. I claim this fight. And I! And I! And I![107] Back! back! Put up your swords! Put up your swords! There’s none alive that shall accept a challenge I have refused. Laegaire, put up your sword! No, let them come. If they’ve a mind for it, I’ll try it out with any two together. That’s spoken as I’d have spoken it at your age. But you are in my house. Whatever man Would fight with you shall fight it out with me. They’re dumb, they’re dumb. How many of you would meet  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0    [Draws sword. This mutterer, this old whistler, this sandpiper, This edge that’s greyer than the tide, this mouse That’s gnawing at the timbers of the world, This, this—— Boy, I would meet them all in arms If I’d a son like you. He would avenge me When I have withstood for the last time the men [108]Whose fathers, brothers, sons, and friends I have killed Upholding Conchubar, when the four provinces Have gathered with the ravens over them. But I’d need no avenger. You and I Would scatter them like water from a dish. We’ll stand by one another from this out. Here is the ring. No, turn and turn about. But my turn’s first because I am the older. Nine queens out of the Country-under-Wave Have woven it with the fleeces of the sea And they were long embroidering at it.—Boy, If I had fought my father, he’d have killed me. As certainly as if I had a son And fought with him, I should be deadly to him; For the old fiery fountains are far off And every day there is less heat o’ the blood. No more of this. I will not have this friendship. Cuchulain is my man, and I forbid it. He shall not go unfought, for I myself—[109] I will not have it. You lay commands on me? You shall not stir, High King. I’ll hold you there. Witchcraft has maddened you. Yes, witchcraft! witchcraft! Some witch has worked upon your mind, Cuchulain. The head of that young man seemed like a woman’s You’d had a fancy for. Then of a sudden You laid your hands on the High King himself! And laid my hands on the High King himself?[110] Some witch is floating in the air above us. Yes, witchcraft, witchcraft! Witches of the air!   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   [To YOUNG MAN. Why did you? Who was it set you to this work? Out, out! I say, for now it’s sword on sword! But .\\xa0.\\xa0. but I did not.

O![112] Who could have thought that one so great as he Should meet his end at this unnoted sword! Life drifts between a fool and a blind man To the end, and nobody can know his end.

       " 'I have a story right, my wanderers, [130]That has so mixed with fable in our songs, That all seemed fabulous. We are come, by chance, Into King Conchubar’s country, and this house Is an old guest-house built for travellers From the seashore to Conchubar’s royal house, And there are certain hills among these woods, And there Queen Deirdre grew. That famous queen Who has been wandering with her lover, Naisi, And none to friend but lovers and wild hearts? Some dozen years ago, King Conchubar found A house upon a hillside in this wood, And there a comely child with an old witch To nurse her, and there’s nobody can say If she were human, or of those begot By an invisible king of the air in a storm On a king’s daughter, or anything at all Of who she was or why she was hidden there But that she’d too much beauty for good luck. He went up thither daily, till at last She put on womanhood, and he lost peace, [131]And Deirdre’s tale began. The King was old. A month or so before the marriage day, A young man, in the laughing scorn of his youth, Naisi, the son of Usnach, climbed up there, And having wooed, or, as some say, been wooed, Carried her off. The tale were well enough Had it a finish. Hush! I have more to tell; But gather close that I may whisper it: I speak of terrible, mysterious ends— The secrets of a king. There’s none to hear! I have been to Conchubar’s house, and followed up A crowd of servants going out and in With loads upon their heads: embroideries To hang upon the walls, or new-mown rushes To strew upon the floors, and came at length To a great room.[132] Be silent; there are steps! You are musicians by these instruments, And if as seems—for you are comely women— You can praise love, you’ll have the best of luck, For there’ll be two, before the night is in, That bargained for their love, and paid for it All that men value. You have but the time To weigh a happy music with the sad; To find what is most pleasing to a lover, Before the son of Usnach and his queen Have passed this threshold. Deirdre and her man! I thought to find a message from the king, And ran to meet it. Is there no messenger From Conchubar to Fergus, son of Rogh? I was to have found a message in this house. Are Deirdre and her lover tired of life?[133] You are not of this country, or you’d know That they are in my charge, and all forgiven. We have no country but the roads of the world. Then you should know that all things change in the world, And hatred turns to love and love to hate, And even kings forgive. An old man’s love Who casts no second line, is hard to cure; His jealousy is like his love. And that’s but true. You have learned something in your wanderings. He was so hard to cure, that the whole court, But I alone, thought it impossible; Yet after I had urged it at all seasons, I had my way, and all’s forgiven now; And you shall speak the welcome and the joy That I lack tongue for.[134] Yet old men are jealous. I am Conchubar’s near friend, and that weighed somewhat, And it was policy to pardon them. The need of some young, famous, popular man To lead the troops, the murmur of the crowd, And his own natural impulse, urged him to it. They have been wandering half-a-dozen years. And yet old men are jealous. Sing the more sweetly Because, though age is arid as a bone, This man has flowered. I’ve need of music, too; If this gray head would suffer no reproach, I’d dance and sing—and dance till the hour ran out, Because I have accomplished this good deed. [135]Look there—there at the window, those dark men, With murderous and outlandish-looking arms— They’ve been about the house all day. What are you? Where do you come from, who is it sent you here? They will not answer you. They do not hear. Forgive my open speech, but to these eyes That have seen many lands, they are such men As kings will gather for a murderous task, That neither bribes, commands, nor promises Can bring their people to. And that is why [136]You harped upon an old man’s jealousy. A trifle sets you quaking. Conchubar’s fame Brings merchandise on every wind that blows. They may have brought him Libyan dragon-skin, Or the ivory of the fierce unicorn. If these be merchants, I have seen the goods They have brought to Conchubar, and understood His murderous purpose. Murderous, you say? Why, what new gossip of the roads is this? But I’ll not hear. It may be life or death. There is a room in Conchubar’s house, and there— Be silent, or I’ll drive you from the door. There’s many a one that would do more than that, And make it prison, or death, or banishment To slander the High King. He is my friend; I have his oath, and I am well content. I have known his mind as if it were my own These many years, and there is none alive Shall buzz against him, and I there to stop it. I know myself, and him, and your wild thought Fed on extravagant poetry, and lit By such a dazzle of old fabulous tales That common things are lost, and all that’s strange Is true because ’twere pity if it were not. Quick! quick! your instruments! they are coming now. I hear the hoofs a-clatter. Begin that song; But what is it to be? I’d have them hear A music foaming up out of the house Like wine out of a cup. Come now, a verse Of some old time not worth remembering, And all the lovelier because a bubble. Begin, begin, of some old king and queen, Of Lugaidh Redstripe or another; no, not him, He and his lady perished wretchedly. ‘Why is it,’ Queen Edain said, ‘If I do but climb the stair.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.’\\n[138] Ah! that is better.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. They are alighted now. Shake all your cockscombs, children; these are lovers. ‘Why is it,’ Queen Edain said, ‘If I do but climb the stair To the tower overhead, When the winds are calling there, Or the gannets calling out, In waste places of the sky, There’s so much to think about, That I cry, that I cry?’ But her goodman answered her: ‘Love would be a thing of naught Had not all his limbs a stir Born out of immoderate thought; Were he anything by half, Were his measure running dry. Lovers, if they may not laugh, Have to cry, have to cry.’ But is Edain worth a song Now the hunt begins anew? Praise the beautiful and strong; Praise the redness of the yew; Praise the blossoming apple-stem. But our silence had been wise. What is all our praise to them, That have one another’s eyes? You are welcome, lady. Conchubar has not come. Were the peace honest, he’d have come himself To prove it so. [140]Being no more in love, He stays in his own house, arranging where The curlew and the plover go, and where The speckled heath-cock in a golden dish. But there’s no messenger. He’ll come himself When all’s in readiness and night closed in; But till that hour, these birds out of the waste Shall put his heart and mind into the music. There’s many a day that I have almost wept To think that one so delicately made Might never know the sweet and natural life Of women born to that magnificence, Quiet and music, courtesy and peace. I have found life obscure and violent, And think it ever so; but none the less I thank you for your kindness, and thank these That put it into music. Your house has been The hole of the badger or the den of the fox; [141]But all that’s finished, and your days will pass From this day out where life is smooth on the tongue, Because the grapes were trodden long ago. If I was childish, and had faith in omens, I’d rather not have lit on that old chessboard At my home-coming. There’s a tale about it— It has been lying there these many years— Some wild old sorrowful tale. It is the board Where Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his, Who had a seamew’s body half the year, Played at the chess upon the night they died. I can remember now a tale of treachery, A broken promise and a journey’s end; But it were best forgot. If the tale is true, [142]When it was plain that they had been betrayed, They moved the men, and waited for the end, As it were bedtime, and had so quiet minds They hardly winked their eyes when the sword flashed. She never could have played so, being a woman, If she had not the cold sea’s blood in her. I have heard that th’ ever-living warn mankind By changing clouds, and casual accidents, Or what seem so. If there had been ill luck In lighting on this chessboard of a sudden, This flagon that stood on it when we came Has made all right again, for it should mean All wrongs forgiven, hospitality For bitter memory, peace after war, While that loaf there should add prosperity. Deirdre will see the world, as it were, new-made, If she’ll but eat and drink. The flagon’s dry, [143]Full of old cobwebs, and the bread is mouldy, Left by some traveller gone upon his way These many weeks. No one to welcome us, And a bare house upon the journey’s end. Is that the welcome that a king spreads out For those that he would honour? Hush! no more. You are King Conchubar’s guest, being in his house. You speak as women do that sit alone, Marking the ashes with a stick till they Are in a dreamy terror. Being a queen, You should have too calm thought to start at shadows. Come, let us look if there’s a messenger From Conchubar’s house. A little way without One sees the road for half a mile or so, Where the trees thin or thicken. When those we love Speak words unfitting to the ear of kings, Kind ears are deaf.[144] Before you came I had to threaten these that would have weighed Some crazy phantasy of their own brain Or gossip of the road with Conchubar’s word. If I had thought so little of mankind I never could have moved him to this pardon. I have believed the best of every man, And find that to believe it is enough To make a bad man show him at his best, Or even a good man swing his lantern higher. If anything lies heavy on your heart, Speak freely of it, knowing it is certain That you will never see my face again. You’ve been in love? [145]If you would speak of love, Speak freely. There is nothing in the world That has been friendly to us but the kisses That were upon our lips, and when we are old Their memory will be all the life we have. There was a man that loved me. He was old; I could not love him. Now I can but fear. He has made promises, and brought me home; But though I turn it over in my thoughts, I cannot tell if they are sound and wholesome, Or hackles on the hook. I have heard he loved you, As some old miser loves the dragon-stone He hides among the cobwebs near the roof. You mean that when a man who has loved like that Is after crossed, love drowns in its own flood, And that love drowned and floating is but hate. And that a king who hates, sleeps ill at night, Till he has killed, and that, though the day laughs, We shall be dead at cockcrow.[146] You have not my thought. When I lost one I loved distractedly, I blamed my crafty rival and not him, And fancied, till my passion had run out, That could I carry him away with me, And tell him all my love, I’d keep him yet. Ah! now I catch your meaning, that this king Will murder Naisi, and keep me alive. ’Tis you that put that meaning upon words Spoken at random. Wanderers like you, Who have their wit alone to keep their lives, Speak nothing that is bitter to the ear At random; if they hint at it at all Their eyes and ears have gathered it so lately That it is crying out in them for speech. We have little that is certain.[147] Certain or not, Speak it out quickly, I beseech you to it; I never have met any of your kind, But that I gave them money, food, and fire. There are strange, miracle-working, wicked stones, Men tear out of the heart and the hot brain Of Libyan dragons. The hot Istain stone, And the cold stone of Fanes, that have power To stir even those at enmity to love. They have so great an influence, if but sewn In the embroideries that curtain in The bridal bed. O Mover of the stars That made this delicate house of ivory, And made my soul its mistress, keep it safe. [148]I have seen a bridal bed, so curtained in, So decked for miracle in Conchubar’s house, And learned that a bride’s coming. And I the bride? Here is worse treachery than the seamew suffered, For she but died and mixed into the dust Of her dear comrade, but I am to live And lie in the one bed with him I hate. Where is Naisi? I was not alone like this When Conchubar first chose me for his wife; I cried in sleeping or waking and he came, But now there is worse need. Why have you called? I was but standing there, without the door. The horses are still saddled, follow me, And hurry to our ships, and get us gone. There’s naught to fear; the king’s forgiven all. [149]She has the heart of a wild bird that fears The net of the fowler or the wicker cage, And has been ever so. Although it’s hard, It is but needful that I stand against you, And if I did not you’d despise me for it, As women do the husbands that they lead Whether for good or evil. I have heard Monstrous, terrible, mysterious things, Magical horrors and the spells of wizards. Why, that’s no wonder, you’ve been listening To singers of the roads that gather up The tales of the whole world, and when they weary Imagine new, or lies about the living, Because their brains are ever upon fire. Is then the king that sends no messenger, And leaves an empty house before a guest, So clear in all he does that no dim word Can light us to a doubt? However dim, [150]Speak it, for I have known King Conchubar Better than my own heart, and I can quench Whatever words have made you doubt him. No, I cannot weigh the gossip of the roads With a king’s word, and were the end but death, I may not doubt him. Naisi, I must speak. Let us begone, this house is no fit place, Being full of doubt—Deirdre is right. No, no, Not by that door that opens on the path That runs to the seashore, but this that leads To Conchubar’s house. We’ll wait no messenger, But go to his well-lighted house, and there Where the rich world runs up into a wick And that burns steadily, because no wind Can blow upon it, bring all doubts to an end. The table has been spread by this, the court Has ridden from all sides to welcome you To safety and to peace.[151] Safety and peace! I had them when a child, but never since. Men blame you that you have stirred a quarrel up That has brought death to many. I have poured Water upon the fire, but if you fly A second time the house is in a blaze And all the screaming household can but blame The savage heart of beauty for it all; And Naisi that but helped to tar the wisp Be but a hunted outlaw all his days. I will be blamed no more! there’s but one way. I’ll spoil this beauty that brought misery And houseless wandering on the man I loved, And so buy peace between him and the king. These wanderers will show me how to do it, To clip my hair to baldness, blacken my skin With walnut juice, and tear my face with briars. Oh! that wild creatures of the woods had torn This body with their claws. What is your meaning? What are you saying? That he loves you still?[152] Whatever were to happen to this face, I’d be myself; and there’s not any way But this way to bring trouble to an end. Answer me—does King Conchubar still love— Does he still covet you? Tell out the plot, The plan, the network, all the treachery, And of the bridal chamber and the bed, The magical stones, the wizard’s handiwork. Take care of Deirdre, if I die in this, For she must never fall into his hands, Whatever the cost. Where would you go to, Naisi? I go to drag the truth from Conchubar, Before his people, in the face of his army, And if it be as black as you have made it, To kill him there.[153] You never would return; I’d never look upon your face again. Oh, keep him, Fergus; do not let him go, But hold him from it. You are both wise and kind. When you were all but Conchubar’s wife, I took you; He tried to kill me, and he would have done it If I had been so near as I am now. And now that you are mine, he has planned to take you. Should I be less than Conchubar, being a man? Supper is on the table; Conchubar Is waiting for his guests. All’s well, again! All’s well! all’s well! You cried your doubts so loud, That I had almost doubted.[154] I would have killed him, And he the while but busy in his house For the more welcome. The message is not finished. Come quickly. Conchubar will laugh, that I— Although I held out boldly in my speech— That I, even I— Wait, wait! He is not done. That am so great a friend, have doubted him. Deirdre, and Fergus, son of Rogh, are summoned; But not the traitor that bore off the queen. It is enough that the king pardon her, And call her to his table and his bed. So, then, it’s treachery.[155] I’ll not believe it. Tell Conchubar to meet me in some place Where none can come between us but our swords. I have done my message; I am Conchubar’s man; I take no message from a traitor’s lips. No, but you must; and I will have you swear To carry it unbroken. He has been suborned. I know King Conchubar’s mind as it were my own; I’ll learn the truth from him. No, no, old man, You thought the best, and the worst came of it; We listened to the counsel of the wise, And so turned fools. But ride and bring your friends. Go, and go quickly. Conchubar has not seen me; It may be that his passion is asleep, And that we may escape. But I’ll go first, And follow up that Libyan heel, and send Such words to Conchubar, that he may know At how great peril he lays hands upon you. The Libyan, knowing that a servant’s life Is safe from hands like mine, but turned and mocked. I’ll call my friends, and call the reaping-hooks, And carry you in safety to the ships. My name has still some power. I will protect, Or, if that is impossible, revenge. The crib has fallen and the birds are in it; There is not one of the great oaks about us But shades a hundred men. Let’s out and die, Or break away, if the chance favour us. They would but drag you from me, stained with blood. Their barbarous weapons would but mar that beauty, And I would have you die as a queen should— In a death chamber. You are in my charge. We will wait here, and when they come upon us, I’ll hold them from the doors, and when that’s over, Give you a cleanly death with this grey edge. I will stay here; but you go out and fight. Our way of life has brought no friends to us, And if we do not buy them leaving it, We shall be ever friendless.[158] What do they say? That Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his Sat at this chessboard, waiting for their end. They knew that there was nothing that could save them, And so played chess as they had any night For years, and waited for the stroke of sword. I never heard a death so out of reach Of common hearts, a high and comely end: What need have I, that gave up all for love, To die like an old king out of a fable, Fighting and passionate? What need is there For all that ostentation at my setting? I have loved truly and betrayed no man. I need no lightning at the end, no beating In a vain fury at the cage’s door. Had you been here when that man and his queen Played at so high a game, could you have found An ancient poem for the praise of it? It should have set out plainly that those two, Because no man and woman have loved better, Might sit on there contentedly, and weigh The joy comes after. I have heard the seamew [159]Sat there, with all the colour in her cheeks, As though she’d say: ‘There’s nothing happening But that a king and queen are playing chess.’ He’s in the right, though I have not been born Of the cold, haughty waves. My veins are hot. But though I have loved better than that queen, I’ll have as quiet fingers on the board. Oh, singing women, set it down in a book That love is all we need, even though it is But the last drops we gather up like this; And though the drops are all we have known of life, For we have been most friendless—praise us for it And praise the double sunset, for naught’s lacking, But a good end to the long, cloudy day. Light torches there and drive the shadows out, For day’s red end comes up. Make no sad music. What is it but a king and queen at chess? They need a music that can mix itself Into imagination, but not break The steady thinking that the hard game needs. Love is an immoderate thing And can never be content, Till it dip an ageing wing, Where some laughing element Leaps and Time’s old lanthorn dims. What’s the merit in love-play, In the tumult of the limbs That dies out before ’tis day, Heart on heart, or mouth on mouth, All that mingling of our breath, When love-longing is but drouth For the things come after death? I cannot go on playing like that woman That had but the cold blood of the sea in her veins.[161] It is your move. Take up your man again. Do you remember that first night in the woods We lay all night on leaves, and looking up, When the first grey of the dawn awoke the birds, Saw leaves above us. You thought that I still slept, And bending down to kiss me on the eyes, Found they were open. Bend and kiss me now, For it may be the last before our death. And when that’s over, we’ll be different; Imperishable things, a cloud or a fire. And I know nothing but this body, nothing But that old vehement, bewildering kiss. Children, beware! He has taken up my challenge; Whether I am a ghost or living man When day has broken, I’ll forget the rest, And say that there is kingly stuff in him. He came to spy upon us, not to fight. A prudent hunter, therefore, but no king. He’d find if what has fallen in the pit Were worth the hunting, but has come too near, And I turn hunter. You’re not man, but beast. Go scurry in the bushes, now, beast, beast, For now it’s topsy-turvy, I upon you. You have a knife there thrust into your girdle. I’d have you give it me. No, but I dare not. No, but you must. If harm should come to you, They’d know I gave it. [163]There is no mark on this To make it different from any other Out of a common forge. You have taken it, I did not give it you; but there are times When such a thing is all the friend one has. The leaves hide all, and there’s no way to find What path to follow. Why is there no sound? Where would you go? To strike a blow for Naisi, If Conchubar call the Libyans to his aid. But why is there no clash? They have met by this! Listen. I am called far-seeing. If Conchubar win, You have a woman’s wile that can do much, Even with men in pride of victory. He is in love and old. What were one knife Among a hundred?[164] Women, if I die, If Naisi die this night, how will you praise? What words seek out? for that will stand to you; For being but dead we shall have many friends. All through your wanderings, the doors of kings Shall be thrown wider open, the poor man’s hearth Heaped with new turf, because you are wearing this  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0    [Gives MUSICIAN a bracelet. To show that you have Deirdre’s story right. Have you not been paid servants in love’s house To sweep the ashes out and keep the doors? And though you have suffered all for mere love’s sake You’d live your lives again. Even this last hour. [165]One woman and two men; that is a quarrel That knows no mending. Bring the man she chose Because of his beauty and the strength of his youth. I have been taken like a bird or a fish. He cried ‘Beast, beast!’ and in a blind-beast rage He ran at me and fell into the nets, But we were careful for your sake, and took him With all the comeliness that woke desire Unbroken in him. I being old and lenient— I would not hurt a hair upon his head. What do you say? Have you forgiven him? He is but mocking us. What’s left to say Now that the seven years’ hunt is at an end? [166]He never doubted you until I made him, And therefore all the blame for what he says Should fall on me. But his young blood is hot, And if we’re of one mind, he shall go free, And I ask nothing for it, or, if something, Nothing I could not take. There is no king In the wide world that, being so greatly wronged, Could copy me, and give all vengeance up. Although her marriage-day had all but come, You carried her away; but I’ll show mercy. Because you had the insolent strength of youth You carried her away; but I’ve had time To think it out through all these seven years. I will show mercy. You have many words. I will not make a bargain; I but ask What is already mine. You may go free If Deirdre will but walk into my house Before the people’s eyes, that they may know When I have put the crown upon her head [167]I have not taken her by force and guile. The doors are open, and the floors are strewed, And in the bridal chamber curtains sewn With all enchantments that give happiness, By races that are germane to the sun, And nearest him, and have no blood in their veins— For when they’re wounded the wound drips with wine— Nor speech but singing. At the bridal door Two fair king’s daughters carry in their hands The crown and robe. Oh, no! Not that, not that. Ask any other thing but that one thing. Leave me with Naisi. We will go away Into some country at the ends of the earth. We’ll trouble you no more. You will be praised By everybody if you pardon us. ‘He is good, he is good,’ they’ll say to one another; ‘There’s nobody like him, for he forgave Deirdre and Naisi.’ Do you think that I [168]Shall let you go again, after seven years Of longing and of planning here and there, And trafficking with merchants for the stones That make all sure, and watching my own face That none might read it? It’s better to go with him. Why should you die when one can bear it all? My life is over; it’s better to obey. Why should you die? I will not live long, Naisi. I’d not have you believe I’d long stay living; Oh no, no, no! You will go far away. You will forget me. Speak, speak, Naisi, speak, And say that it is better that I go. I will not ask it. Do not speak a word, For I will take it all upon myself. Conchubar, I will go. And do you think That, were I given life at such a price, I would not cast it from me? O, my eagle! Why do you beat vain wings upon the rock When hollow night’s above? It’s better, Naisi. [169]It may be hard for you, but you’ll forget. For what am I, to be remembered always? And there are other women. There was one, The daughter of the King of Leodas; I could not sleep because of her. Speak to him; Tell it out plain, and make him understand. And if it be he thinks I shall stay living, Say that I will not. Would I had lost life Among those Scottish kings that sought it of me, Because you were my wife, or that the worst Had taken you before this bargaining! O eagle! if you were to do this thing, And buy my life of Conchubar with your body, Love’s law being broken, I would stand alone Upon the eternal summits, and call out, And you could never come there, being banished. I would obey, but cannot. Pardon us. I know that you are good. I have heard you praised For giving gifts; and you will pardon us, Although I cannot go into your house. It was my fault. I only should be punished. The very moment these eyes fell on him, I told him; I held out my hands to him; How could he refuse? At first he would not— I am not lying—he remembered you. What do I say? My hands?—No, no, my lips— For I had pressed my lips upon his lips— I swear it is not false—my breast to his; Until I woke the passion that’s in all, And how could he resist? I had my beauty. You may have need of him, a brave, strong man, Who is not foolish at the council board, Nor does he quarrel by the candle-light And give hard blows to dogs. A cup of wine Moves him to mirth, not madness. What am I saying? You may have need of him, for you have none Who is so good a sword, or so well loved Among the common people. You may need him, And what king knows when the hour of need may come? You dream that you have men enough. You laugh. [171]Yes; you are laughing to yourself. You say, ‘I am Conchubar—I have no need of him.’ You will cry out for him some day and say, ‘If Naisi were but living’——[She misses NAISI.] Where is he? Where have you sent him? Where is the son of Usna? Where is he, O, where is he? The traitor who has carried off my wife No longer lives. Come to my house now, Deirdre, For he that called himself your husband’s dead. O, do not touch me. Let me go to him. King Conchubar is right. My husband’s dead. A single woman is of no account, Lacking array of servants, linen cupboards, The bacon hanging—and King Conchubar’s house [172]All ready, too—I’ll to King Conchubar’s house. It is but wisdom to do willingly What has to be. But why are you so calm? I thought that you would curse me and cry out, And fall upon the ground and tear your hair. You know too much of women to think so; Though, if I were less worthy of desire, I would pretend as much; but, being myself, It is enough that you were master here. Although we are so delicately made, There’s something brutal in us, and we are won By those who can shed blood. It was some woman That taught you how to woo: but do not touch me, For I’ll go with you and do all your will When I have done whatever’s customary. We lay the dead out, folding up the hands, Closing the eyes, and stretching out the feet, And push a pillow underneath the head, Till all’s in order; and all this I’ll do For Naisi, son of Usna.[173] It is not fitting. You are not now a wanderer, but a queen, And there are plenty that can do these things. No, no. Not yet. I cannot be your queen Till the past’s finished, and its debts are paid. When a man dies and there are debts unpaid, He wanders by the debtor’s bed and cries, There’s so much owing. You are deceiving me. You long to look upon his face again. Why should I give you now to a dead man That took you from a living? In good time. You’ll stir me to more passion than he could, And yet, if you are wise, you’ll grant me this: That I go look upon him that was once So strong and comely and held his head so high That women envied me. For I will see him [174]All blood-bedabbled and his beauty gone. It’s better, when you’re beside me in your strength, That the mind’s eye should call up the soiled body, And not the shape I loved. Look at him, women. He heard me pleading to be given up, Although my lover was still living, and yet He doubts my purpose. I will have you tell him How changeable all women are. How soon Even the best of lovers is forgot, When his day’s finished. No; but I will trust The strength you have spoken of, and not your purpose. I’ll have this gift—the first that I have asked. He has refused. There is no sap in him, Nothing but empty veins. I thought as much. He has refused me the first thing I have asked— Me, me, his wife. I understand him now; I know the sort of life I’ll have with him; [175]But he must drag me to his house by force. If he refuse [she laughs], he shall be mocked of all. They’ll say to one another, ‘Look at him That is so jealous that he lured a man From over sea, and murdered him, and yet He trembled at the thought of a dead face!’ How do I know that you have not some knife, And go to die upon his body? Have me searched, If you would make so little of your queen. It may be that I have a knife hid here Under my dress. Bid one of these dark slaves To search me for it. Go to your farewells, queen. Now strike the wire, and sing to it awhile, Knowing that all is happy, and that you know Within what bride-bed I shall lie this night, [176]And by what man, and lie close up to him, For the bed’s narrow, and there outsleep the cockcrow. [She goes behind the curtain. They are gone, they are gone. The proud may lie by the proud. Though we were bidden to sing, cry nothing loud. They are gone, they are gone. Whispering were enough. Into the secret wilderness of their love. A high, grey cairn. What more is to be said? Eagles have gone into their cloudy bed. Where’s Naisi, son of Usna, and his queen? I and a thousand reaping-hooks and scythes Demand him of you. You have come too late. I have accomplished all. Deirdre is mine; She is my queen, and no man now can rob me. I had to climb the topmost bough and pull This apple among the winds. Open the curtain, That Fergus learn my triumph from her lips. No, no; I’ll not believe it. She is not dead— She cannot have escaped a second time! King, she is dead; but lay no hand upon her. What’s this but empty cage and tangled wire, Now the bird’s gone? but I’ll not have you touch it. You are all traitors, all against me—all. And she has deceived me for a second time. And every common man may keep his wife, But not the King.[178] I have no need of weapons, There’s not a traitor that dare stop my way. Howl, if you will; but I, being king, did right In choosing her most fitting to be queen, And letting no boy lover take the sway.',\n",
       " 'I walked among the seven woods of Coole, Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn; Shady Kyle-dortha; sunnier Kyle-na-gno, Where many hundred squirrels are as happy As though they had been hidden by green boughs, Where old age cannot find them; Pairc-na-lea, Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths; Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling Their sudden fragrances on the green air; Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes Have seen immortal, mild, proud shadows walk; Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox And marten-cat, and borders that old wood Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood: Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods. I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes, Yet dreamed that beings happier than men Moved round me in the shadows, and at night My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires; And the images I have woven in this story Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters Moved round me in the voices and the fires, And more I may not write of, for they that cleave The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue [182]Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence. How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows? I only know that all we know comes from you, And that you come from Eden on flying feet. Is Eden far away, or do you hide From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys That run before the reaping-hook and lie In the last ridge of the barley? Do our woods And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods, More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds? Is Eden out of time and out of space? And do you gather about us when pale light Shining on water and fallen among leaves, And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?',\n",
       " 'I have made this poem for you, that men may read it Before they read of Forgael and Dectora, As men in the old times, before the harps began, Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.',\n",
       " 'Edain came out of Midher’s hill, and lay Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass, Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds And druid moons, and murmuring of boughs, And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made Of opal and ruby and pale chrysolite Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings, Sweet with all music, out of his long hair, Because her hands had been made wild by love; When Midher’s wife had changed her to a fly, He made a harp with druid apple wood That she among her winds might know he wept; And from that hour he has watched over none But faithful lovers.[184]',\n",
       " 'Has he not led us into these waste seas For long enough?[186] Aye, long and long enough. We have not come upon a shore or ship These dozen weeks. And I had thought to make A good round sum upon this cruise, and turn— For I am getting on in life—to something That has less ups and downs than robbery. I am so lecherous with abstinence I’d give the profit of nine voyages For that red Moll that had but the one eye. And all the ale ran out at the new moon; And now that time puts water in my blood, The ale cup is my father and my mother. It would be better to turn home again, Whether he will or no; and better still To make an end while he is sleeping there. If we were of one mind I’d do it.[187] Were’t not That there is magic in that harp of his, That makes me fear to raise a hand against him, I would be of your mind; but when he plays it Strange creatures flutter up before one’s eyes, Or cry about one’s ears. Nothing to fear. Do you remember when we sank that galley At the full moon? He played all through the night. Until the moon had set; and when I looked Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird Like a grey gull upon the breast of each. While I was looking they rose hurriedly, And after circling with strange cries awhile Flew westward; and many a time since then I’ve heard a rustling overhead in the wind.[188] I saw them on that night as well as you. But when I had eaten and drunk a bellyful My courage came again. But that’s not all. The other night, while he was playing it, A beautiful young man and girl came up In a white, breaking wave; they had the look Of those that are alive for ever and ever. I saw them, too, one night. Forgael was playing, And they were listening there beyond the sail. He could not see them, but I held out my hands To grasp the woman. You have dared to touch her? O, she was but a shadow, and slipped from me. But were you not afraid? Why should I fear?[189] ’Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering lovers, To whom all lovers pray. But what of that? A shadow does not carry sword or spear. My mother told me that there is not one Of the ever-living half so dangerous As that wild Aengus. Long before her day He carried Edain off from a king’s house, And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone And in a tower of glass, and from that day Has hated every man that’s not in love, And has been dangerous to him. I have heard He does not hate seafarers as he hates Peaceable men that shut the wind away, And keep to the one weary marriage-bed. I think that he has Forgael in his net, And drags him through the sea.[190] Well, net or none, I’d kill him while we have the chance to do it. It’s certain I’d sleep easier o’ nights If he were dead; but who will be our captain, Judge of the stars, and find a course for us? I’ve thought of that. We must have Aibric with us, For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.',\n",
       " 'Become our captain, Aibric. I am resolved To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps. There’s not a man but will be glad of it When it is over, nor one to grumble at us. You’ll have the captain’s share of everything. Silence! for you have taken Forgael’s pay. We joined him for his pay, but have had none [191]This long while now; we had not turned against him If he had brought us among peopled seas, For that was in the bargain when we struck it. What good is there in this hard way of living, Unless we drain more flagons in a year And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men In their long lives? If you’ll be of our troop You’ll be as good a leader. Be of your troop! No, nor with a hundred men like you, When Forgael’s in the other scale. I’d say it Even if Forgael had not been my master From earliest childhood, but that being so, If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard I’ll give my answer. You have awaked him. We’d better go, for we have lost this chance. Have the birds passed us? I could hear your voice. But there were others.[192] I have seen nothing pass. You’re certain of it? I never wake from sleep But that I am afraid they may have passed, For they’re my only pilots. If I lost them Straying too far into the north or south, I’d never come upon the happiness That has been promised me. I have not seen them These many days; and yet there must be many Dying at every moment in the world, And flying towards their peace. Put by these thoughts, And listen to me for awhile. The sailors Are plotting for your death. Have I not given More riches than they ever hoped to find? And now they will not follow, while I seek The only riches that have hit my fancy. What riches can you find in this waste sea [193]Where no ship sails, where nothing that’s alive Has ever come but those man-headed birds, Knowing it for the world’s end? Where the world ends The mind is made unchanging, for it finds Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope, The flagstone under all, the fire of fires, The roots of the world. Who knows that shadows May not have driven you mad for their own sport? Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their plot? No, no, do not say that. You know right well That I will never lift a hand against you. Why should you be more faithful than the rest, Being as doubtful? I have called you master Too many years to lift a hand against you.[194] Maybe it is but natural to doubt me. You’ve never known, I’d lay a wager on it, A melancholy that a cup of wine, A lucky battle, or a woman’s kiss Could not amend. I have good spirits enough. I’ve nothing to complain of but heartburn, And that is cured by a boiled liquorice root. If you will give me all your mind awhile— All, all, the very bottom of the bowl— I’ll show you that I am made differently, That nothing can amend it but these waters, Where I am rid of life—the events of the world— What do you call it?—that old promise-breaker, The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering, ‘You will have all you have wished for when you have earned Land for your children or money in a pot.’ And when we have it we are no happier, Because of that old draught under the door, [195]Or creaky shoes. And at the end of all We have been no better off than Seaghan the fool, That never did a hand’s turn. Aibric! Aibric! We have fallen in the dreams the ever-living Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world, And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh, And find their laughter sweeter to the taste For that brief sighing. If you had loved some woman— You say that also? You have heard the voices, For that is what they say—all, all the shadows— Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers, And all the others; but it must be love As they have known it. Now the secret’s out; For it is love that I am seeking for, But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind That is not in the world. And yet the world Has beautiful women to please every man. [196]But he that gets their love after the fashion Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope And bodily tenderness, and finds that even The bed of love, that in the imagination Had seemed to be the giver of all peace, Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting, And as soon finished. All that ever loved Have loved that way—there is no other way. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they Believed there was some other near at hand, And almost wept because they could not find it. When they have twenty years; in middle life They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth, And let the dream go by. It’s not a dream, But the reality that makes our passion As a lamp shadow—no—no lamp, the sun. What the world’s million lips are thirsting for, Must be substantial somewhere.[197] I have heard the Druids Mutter such things as they awake from trance. It may be that the ever-living know it— No mortal can. Yes; if they give us help. They are besotting you as they besot The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows That he has been all night upon the hills, Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host With the ever-living. What if he speak the truth, And for a dozen hours have been a part Of that more powerful life? His wife knows better. Has she not seen him lying like a log, Or fumbling in a dream about the house? And if she hear him mutter of wild riders, She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing That set him to the fancy.[198] All would be well Could we but give us wholly to the dreams, And get into their world that to the sense Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly Among substantial things; for it is dreams That lift us to the flowing, changing world That the heart longs for. What is love itself, Even though it be the lightest of light love, But dreams that hurry from beyond the world To make low laughter more than meat and drink, Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer, Could we but mix ourselves into a dream, Not in its image on the mirror! While We’re in the body that’s impossible. And yet I cannot think they’re leading me To death; for they that promised to me love As those that can outlive the moon have known it, Had the world’s total life gathered up, it seemed, [199]Into their shining limbs—I’ve had great teachers. Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave— You’d never doubt that it was life they promised Had you looked on them face to face as I did, With so red lips, and running on such feet, And having such wide-open, shining eyes. It’s certain they are leading you to death. None but the dead, or those that never lived, Can know that ecstasy. Forgael! Forgael! They have made you follow the man-headed birds, And you have told me that their journey lies Towards the country of the dead. What matter If I am going to my death, for there, Or somewhere, I shall find the love they have promised. That much is certain. I shall find a woman, One of the ever-living, as I think— One of the laughing people—and she and I Shall light upon a place in the world’s core, Where passion grows to be a changeless thing, Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase, Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysolite; [200]And there, in juggleries of sight and sense, Become one movement, energy, delight, Until the overburthened moon is dead. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice! And we are almost on her! We had not known But for the ambergris and sandalwood. No; but opoponax and cinnamon. The ever-living have kept my bargain for me, And paid you on the nail. Take up that rope To make her fast while we are plundering her. There is a king and queen upon her deck, And where there is one woman there’ll be others.[201] Speak lower, or they’ll hear. They cannot hear; They are too busy with each other. Look! He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips. When she finds out we have better men aboard She may not be too sorry in the end. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens Care more about the kegs of silver and gold, And the high fame that come to them in marriage, Than a strong body and a ready hand. There’s nobody is natural but a robber, And that is why the world totters about Upon its bandy legs. Run at them now, And overpower the crew while yet asleep! Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain! Wake all below! Why have you broken our sleep? Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain! There! there they come! Gull, gannet, or diver, But with a man’s head, or a fair woman’s, They hover over the masthead awhile To wait their friends; but when their friends have come They’ll fly upon that secret way of theirs. One—and one—a couple—five together; And I will hear them talking in a minute. [203]Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words. Now I can hear. There’s one of them that says: ‘How light we are, now we are changed to birds!’ Another answers: ‘Maybe we shall find Our heart’s desire now that we are so light.’ And then one asks another how he died, And says: ‘A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.’ And now they all wheel suddenly and fly To the other side, and higher in the air. And now a laggard with a woman’s head Comes crying, ‘I have run upon the sword. I have fled to my beloved in the air, In the waste of the high air, that we may wander Among the windy meadows of the dawn.’ But why are they still waiting? why are they Circling and circling over the masthead? What power that is more mighty than desire To hurry to their hidden happiness Withholds them now? Have the ever-living ones A meaning in that circling overhead? But what’s the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you linger there? Why do you not run to your desire, Now that you have happy winged bodies? Being too busy in the air and the high air, They cannot hear my voice; but what’s the meaning? Why are you standing with your eyes upon me? You are not the world’s core. O no, no, no! That cannot be the meaning of the birds. You are not its core. My teeth are in the world, But have not bitten yet. I am a queen, And ask for satisfaction upon these Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me. Let go my hands! [205]Why do you cast a shadow? Where do you come from? Who brought you to this place? They would not send me one that casts a shadow. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships, And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations, And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow, Had drowned me also. But, being yet alive, I ask a fitting punishment for all That raised their hands against him. There are some That weigh and measure all in these waste seas— They that have all the wisdom that’s in life, And all that prophesying images Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs; They have it that the plans of kings and queens Are dust on the moth’s wing; that nothing matters But laughter and tears—laughter, laughter, and tears; That every man should carry his own soul Upon his shoulders. [206]You’ve nothing but wild words, And I would know if you will give me vengeance. When she finds out I will not let her go— When she knows that. What is it that you are muttering— That you’ll not let me go? I am a queen. Although you are more beautiful than any, I almost long that it were possible; But if I were to put you on that ship, With sailors that were sworn to do your will, And you had spread a sail for home, a wind Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge, It had washed among the stars and put them out, And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine, Until you stood before me on the deck— As now. Does wandering in these desolate seas And listening to the cry of wind and wave Bring madness? Queen, I am not mad.[207] And yet you say the water and the wind Would rise against me. No, I am not mad— If it be not that hearing messages From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon, At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken. And did those watchers bid you take me captive? Both you and I are taken in the net. It was their hands that plucked the winds awake And blew you hither; and their mouths have promised I shall have love in their immortal fashion. They gave me that old harp of the nine spells That is more mighty than the sun and moon, Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars, That none might take you from me. For a moment [208]Your raving of a message and a harp More mighty than the stars half troubled me. But all that’s raving. Who is there can compel The daughter and granddaughter of kings To be his bedfellow? Until your lips Have called me their beloved, I’ll not kiss them. My husband and my king died at my feet, And yet you talk of love. The movement of time Is shaken in these seas, and what one does One moment has no might upon the moment That follows after. I understand you now. You have a Druid craft of wicked sound Wrung from the cold women of the sea— A magic that can call a demon up, Until my body give you kiss for kiss. Your soul shall give the kiss.[209] I am not afraid, While there’s a rope to run into a noose Or wave to drown. But I have done with words, And I would have you look into my face And know that it is fearless. Do what you will, For neither I nor you can break a mesh Of the great golden net that is about us. There’s nothing in the world that’s worth a fear. I have good reason for that thought. And now I can put fear away as a queen should. Fool, fool! Although you have looked into my face You do not see my purpose. I shall have gone Before a hand can touch me.[210] My hands are still; The ever-living hold us. Do what you will, You cannot leap out of the golden net. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon us And measure out a course and bring us home, We’ll put this man to death. I promise it. There is none to take his side. I am on his side. I’ll strike a blow for him to give him time To cast his dreams away. No other’ll do it. He has put a sudden darkness over the moon. Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn To him that strikes him first! I will strike him first. [Shrinking back.] He has caught the crescent moon out of the sky, And carries it between us. Holy fire Has come into the jewels of the harp To burn us to the marrow if we strike. I’ll give a golden galley full of fruit, That has the heady flavour of new wine, To him that wounds him to the death. I’ll do it. For all his spells will vanish when he dies, Having their life in him.[212] Though it be the moon That he is holding up between us there, I will strike at him. And I! And I! And I! But you were saying there is somebody Upon that other ship we are to wake. You did not know what brought him to his end, But it was sudden. You are in the right; I had forgotten that we must go wake him. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air, And set you dreaming. How can we have a wake When we have neither brown nor yellow ale? I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.[213] How can we raise the keen that do not know What name to call him by? Come to his ship. His name will come into our thoughts in a minute. I know that he died a thousand years ago, And has not yet been waked. Ohone! O! O! O! The yew bough has been broken into two, And all the birds are scattered. O! O! O! O! Protect me now, gods, that my people swear by. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is! Queen, give it me. No, I have need of it. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it, Now that he’s dead I have no need of it, For everything is gone. Come hither, Aibric, And tell me who it is that we are waking. What name had that dead king? Arthur of Britain? No, no—not Arthur. I remember now. It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died Brokenhearted, having lost his queen Through wicked spells. That is not all the tale, For he was killed. O! O! O! O! O! O! For golden-armed Iollan has been killed. I will end all your magic on the instant. This sword is to lie beside him in the grave. It was in all his battles. I will spread my hair, And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly, For I have heard that he was proud and laughing, Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet, And that he died a thousand years ago. O! O! O! But no, that is not it. I knew him well, and while I heard him laughing They killed him at my feet. O! O! O! O! For golden-armed Iollan that I loved. But what is it that made me say I loved him? It was that harper put it in my thoughts, But it is true. Why did they run upon him, And beat the golden helmet with their swords?[216] Do you not know me, lady? I am he That you are weeping for. No, for he is dead. O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan. It was so given out, but I will prove That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy Have buried nothing but my golden arms. Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon And you will recollect my face and voice, For you have listened to me playing it These thousand years. What are the birds at there? Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden? What are you calling out above the mast? If railing and reproach and mockery Because I have awakened her to love My magic strings, I’ll make this answer to it: Being driven on by voices and by dreams [217]That were clear messages from the ever-living, I have done right. What could I but obey? And yet you make a clamour of reproach. Why, it’s a wonder out of reckoning That I should keen him from the full of the moon To the horn, and he be hale and hearty. How have I wronged her now that she is merry? But no, no, no! your cry is not against me. You know the councils of the ever-living, And all that tossing of your wings is joy, And all that murmuring’s but a marriage song; But if it be reproach, I answer this: There is not one among you that made love By any other means. You call it passion, Consideration, generosity; But it was all deceit, and flattery To win a woman in her own despite, For love is war, and there is hatred in it; And if you say that she came willingly— Why do you turn away and hide your face, That I would look upon for ever?[218] My grief. Have I not loved you for a thousand years? I never have been golden-armed Iollan. I do not understand. I know your face Better than my own hands. I have deceived you Out of all reckoning. Is it not true That you were born a thousand years ago, In islands where the children of Aengus wind In happy dances under a windy moon, And that you’ll bring me there? I have deceived you; I have deceived you utterly. How can that be? [219]Is it that though your eyes are full of love Some other woman has a claim on you, And I’ve but half? Oh, no! And if there is, If there be half a hundred more, what matter? I’ll never give another thought to it; No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak. Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted, Their heads being turned with praise and flattery; And that is why their lovers are afraid To tell them a plain story. That’s not the story; But I have done so great a wrong against you, There is no measure that it would not burst. I will confess it all. What do I care, Now that my body has begun to dream, And you have grown to be a burning sod [220]In the imagination and intellect? If something that’s most fabulous were true— If you had taken me by magic spells, And killed a lover or husband at my feet— I would not let you speak, for I would know That it was yesterday and not to-day I loved him; I would cover up my ears, As I am doing now. [A pause.] Why do you weep? I weep because I’ve nothing for your eyes But desolate waters and a battered ship. O, why do you not lift your eyes to mine? I weep—I weep because bare night’s above, And not a roof of ivory and gold. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof, And strike the golden pillars with my hands. I would that there was nothing in the world But my beloved—that night and day had perished, And all that is and all that is to be, All that is not the meeting of our lips.[221] I too, I too. Why do you look away? Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon My enemy? I looked upon the moon, Longing to knead and pull it into shape That I might lay it on your head as a crown. But now it is your thoughts that wander away, For you are looking at the sea. Do you not know How great a wrong it is to let one’s thought Wander a moment when one is in love? Why are you looking at the sea? Look there! What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds That fly into the west? But listen, listen! What is there but the crying of the birds?[222] If you’ll but listen closely to that crying You’ll hear them calling out to one another With human voices. O, I can hear them now. What are they? Unto what country do they fly? To unimaginable happiness. They have been circling over our heads in the air, But now that they have taken to the road We have to follow, for they are our pilots; And though they’re but the colour of grey ash, They’re crying out, could you but hear their words, ‘There is a country at the end of the world Where no child’s born but to outlive the moon.’ The hold is full of treasure. Full to the hatches.[223] Treasure and treasure. Boxes of precious spice. Ivory images with amethyst eyes. Dragons with eyes of ruby. The whole ship Flashes as if it were a net of herrings. Let’s home; I’d give some rubies to a woman. There’s somebody I’d give the amethyst eyes to. Let’s home and spend it in our villages. We would return to our own country, Forgael, [224]For we have found a treasure that’s so great Imagination cannot reckon it. And having lit upon this woman there, What more have you to look for on the seas? I cannot—I am going on to the end. As for this woman, I think she is coming with me. The ever-living have made you mad; but no, It was this woman in her woman’s vengeance That drove you to it, and I fool enough To fancy that she’d bring you home again. ’Twas you that egged him to it, for you know That he is being driven to his death. That is not true, for he has promised me An unimaginable happiness. And if that happiness be more than dreams, More than the froth, the feather, the dustwhirl, The crazy nothing that I think it is, It shall be in the country of the dead, If there be such a country. No, not there, [225]But in some island where the life of the world Leaps upward, as if all the streams o’ the world Had run into one fountain. Speak to him. He knows that he is taking you to death; Speak—he will not deny it. Is that true? I do not know for certain, but I know That I have the best of pilots. Shadows, illusions, That the shape-changers, the ever-laughing ones, The immortal mockers have cast into his mind, Or called before his eyes. O carry me To some sure country, some familiar place. Have we not everything that life can give In having one another?[226] How could I rest If I refused the messengers and pilots With all those sights and all that crying out? But I will cover up your eyes and ears, That you may never hear the cry of the birds, Or look upon them. Were they but lowlier I’d do your will, but they are too high—too high. Being too high, their heady prophecies But harry us with hopes that come to nothing, Because we are not proud, imperishable, Alone and winged. Our love shall be like theirs When we have put their changeless image on. I am a woman, I die at every breath.[227] Let the birds scatter for the tree is broken. And there’s no help in words. [To the SAILORS.] To the other ship, And I will follow you and cut the rope When I have said farewell to this man here, For neither I nor any living man Will look upon his face again. Go with him, For he will shelter you and bring you home. I’ll do it for his sake. No. Take this sword And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael. The yew bough has been broken into two, And all the birds are scattered—O! O! O! Farewell! farewell! The sword is in the rope— The rope’s in two—it falls into the sea, It whirls into the foam. O ancient worm, Dragon that loved the world and held us to it, You are broken, you are broken. The world drifts away, And I am left alone with my beloved, Who cannot put me from his sight for ever. We are alone for ever, and I laugh, Forgael, because you cannot put me from you. The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I Shall be alone for ever. We two—this crown— I half remember. It has been in my dreams. Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it. O flower of the branch, O bird among the leaves, O silver fish that my two hands have taken Out of the running stream, O morning star, Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn Upon the misty border of the wood, Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair, For we will gaze upon this world no longer. Beloved, having dragged the net about us, And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal; And that old harp awakens of itself To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams, That have had dreams for father, live in us.',\n",

As in the old days when they would come and go About my threshold to counsel and to help.’ The parted lips replied, ‘I seek your help, [47]For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love.’ ‘How may a mortal whose life gutters out Help them that wander with hand clasping hand, Their haughty images that cannot wither For all their beauty’s like a hollow dream, Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain Nor the cold North has troubled?’ He replied: ‘I am from those rivers and I bid you call The children of the Maines out of sleep, And set them digging into Anbual’s hill. We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house, Will overthrow his shadows and carry off Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love. I helped your fathers when they built these walls, And I would have your help in my great need, Queen of high Cruachan.’ ‘I obey your will With speedy feet and a most thankful heart: For you have been, O Aengus of the birds, Our giver of good counsel and good luck.’ And with a groan, as if the mortal breath Could but awaken sadly upon lips That happier breath had moved, her husband turned [48]Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep; But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot, Came to the threshold of the painted house, Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud, Until the pillared dark began to stir With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.',\n",

Outrun the measure. I’d tell of that great queen Who stood amid a silence by the thorn Until two lovers came out of the air With bodies made out of soft fire. The one, About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings, Said: ‘Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.’ [50]Then Maeve: ‘O Aengus, Master of all lovers, A thousand years ago you held high talk With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan.

       " 'What were our praise to them? they eat Quiet’s wild heart, like daily meat; Who when night thickens are afloat On dappled skins in a glass boat, Far out under a windless sky; While over them birds of Aengus fly, And over the tiller and the prow, And waving white wings to and fro Awaken wanderings of light air To stir their coverlet and their hair.',\n",
       " 'And poets found, old writers say, A yew tree where his body lay; But a wild apple hid the grass With its sweet blossom where hers was; And being in good heart, because A better time had come again After the deaths of many men, And that long fighting at the ford, They wrote on tablets of thin board, Made of the apple and the yew, [61]All the love stories that they knew.',\n",
       " 'Let rush and bird cry out their fill Of the harper’s daughter if they will, Beloved, I am not afraid of her. She is not wiser nor lovelier, And you are more high of heart than she, For all her wanderings over-sea; But I’d have bird and rush forget Those other two; for never yet Has lover lived, but longed to wive Like them that are no more alive.',\n",
       " 'I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees Hum in the lime tree flowers; and put away The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile Tara uprooted, and new commonness Upon the throne and crying about the streets And hanging its paper flowers from post to post, Because it is alone of all things happy. I am contented for I know that Quiet Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer, Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs A cloudy quiver over Parc-na-Lee.',\n",
