The host is riding from Knocknarea And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare; Caolte tossing his burning hair And Niamh calling Away, come away: Empty your heart of its mortal dream. The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round, Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound, Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam, Our arms are waving, our lips are apart; And if any gaze on our rushing band, We come between him and the deed of his hand, We come between him and the hope of his heart. The host is rushing ’twixt night and day, And where is there hope or deed as fair? Caolte tossing his burning hair, And Niamh calling Away, come away.The dancers crowded about him, And many a sweet thing said, And a young man brought him red wine [7]And a young girl white bread.I thought of your beauty, and this arrow, Made out of a wild thought, is in my marrow. There’s no man may look upon her, no man; As when newly grown to be a woman,Blossom pale, she pulled down the pale blossom At the moth hour and hid it in her bosom. This beauty’s kinder, yet for a reason I could weep that the old is out of season.One that is ever kind said yesterday: ‘Your well-beloved’s hair has threads of grey, And little shadows come about her eyes; Time can but make it easier to be wise, Though now it’s hard, till trouble is at an end; And so be patient, be wise and patient, friend.’ But, heart, there is no comfort, not a grain; Time can but make her beauty over again, Because of that great nobleness of hers; The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs Burns but more clearly. O she had not these ways, When all the wild summer was in her gaze. O heart! O heart! if she’d but turn her head, You’d know the folly of being comforted.I thought to fly to her when the end of day Awakens an old memory, and say, ‘Your strength, that is so lofty and fierce and kind, It might call up a new age, calling to mind The queens that were imagined long ago, Is but half yours: he kneaded in the dough Through the long years of youth, and who would have thought It all, and more than it all, would come to naught, And that dear words meant nothing?’ But enough, For when we have blamed the wind we can blame love; Or, if there needs be more, be nothing said That would be harsh for children that have strayed.Never give all the heart, for love Will hardly seem worth thinking of To passionate women if it seem Certain, and they never dream That it fades out from kiss to kiss; For everything that’s lovely is But a brief dreamy kind delight. O never give the heart outright, For they, for all smooth lips can say, Have given their hearts up to the play. And who could play it well enough If deaf and dumb and blind with love? He that made this knows all the cost, For he gave all his heart and lost.I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds, ‘Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will, I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words, For the roads are unending, and there is no place to my mind.’ The honey-pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill, And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams. No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.I know of the leafy paths that the witches take, Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool, [71]And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake; I know where a dim moon drifts, where the Danaan kind Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam gleams. No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round Coupled with golden chains, and sing as they fly. A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by; I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams. No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind; The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.We sat together at one summer’s end, That beautiful mild woman, your close friend, And you and I, and talked of poetry.I said: ‘A line will take us hours maybe; Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought, Our stitching and unstitching has been naught. Better go down upon your marrow bones And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather; For to articulate sweet sounds together Is to work harder than all these, and yet Be thought an idler by the noisy set Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen The martyrs call the world.’But Bridget drew him by the sleeve, Away from the merry bands, To old men playing at cards With a twinkling of ancient hands.That woman then Murmured with her young voice, for whose mild sake There’s many a one shall find out all heartache [73]In finding that it’s young and mild and low: ‘There is one thing that all we women know, Although we never heard of it at school— That we must labour to be beautiful.’I said: ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring. There have been lovers who thought love should be So much compounded of high courtesy That they would sigh and quote with learned looks Precedents out of beautiful old books; Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.’We sat grown quiet at the name of love; We saw the last embers of daylight die, And in the trembling blue-green of the sky A moon, worn as if it had been a shell Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell About the stars and broke in days and years.I had a thought for no one’s but your ears; That you were beautiful, and that I strove To love you in the old high way of love; That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown As weary hearted as that hollow moon.The old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand, Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand; Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies, But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea, And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say. Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat; But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet [75]Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare, For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air; Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood; But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.I heard the old, old men say, ‘Everything alters, And one by one we drop away.’ They had hands like claws, and their knees Were twisted like the old thorn trees By the waters. I heard the old, old men say, ‘All that’s beautiful drifts away Like the waters.’I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde, Nor Avalon the grass-green hollow, nor Joyous Isle, Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while; Nor Ulad, when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind, Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart; Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon’s light and the sun’s Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long-lived ones; Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart, And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn, To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier: Therein are many queens like Branwen and Guinivere; [77]And Niamh and Laban and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn, And the wood-woman, whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk; And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore, Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar, I hear the harp-string praise them, or hear their mournful talk. Because of a story I heard under the thin horn Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day, To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay, Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.O hurry to the water amid the trees, For there the tall deer and his leman sigh When they have but looked upon their images, O that none ever loved but you and I!The bread and the wine had a doom, For these were the host of the air; He sat and played in a dream Of her long dim hair.Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed, Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky, When the sun looked out of his golden hood, O that none ever loved but you and I!O hurry to the hollow wood, for there I will drive out the deer and moon and cry— O my share of the world, O yellow hair, No one has ever loved but you and I!Sweetheart, do not love too long: I loved long and long, And grew to be out of fashion Like an old song.All through the years of our youth Neither could have known Their own thought from the other’s, We were so much at one.But, O in a minute she changed— O do not love too long, Or you will grow out of fashion Like an old song.Hurry to bless the hands that play, The mouths that speak, the notes and strings, O masters of the glittering town! O! lay the shrilly trumpet down, Though drunken with the flags that sway Over the ramparts and the towers, And with the waving of your wings.Maybe they linger by the way. One gathers up his purple gown; One leans and mutters by the wall— He dreads the weight of mortal hours.O no, O no! they hurry down Like plovers that have heard the call.[81]O kinsmen of the Three in One, O kinsmen bless the hands that play. The notes they waken shall live on When all this heavy history’s done; Our hands, our hands must ebb away.The proud and careless notes live on, But bless our hands that ebb away.He played with the merry old men And thought not of evil chance, Until one bore Bridget his bride Away from the merry dance.There’s many a strong farmer Whose heart would break in two, If he could see the townland That we are riding to; Boughs have their fruit and blossom At all times of the year; Rivers are running over With red beer and brown beer. An old man plays the bagpipes In a golden and silver wood; Queens, their eyes blue like the ice, Are dancing in a crowd.The little fox he murmured, ‘O what of the world’s bane?’ The sun was laughing sweetly, The moon plucked at my rein; But the little red fox murmured, ‘O do not pluck at his rein, He is riding to the townland [83]That is the world’s bane.’When their hearts are so high That they would come to blows, They unhook their heavy swords From golden and silver boughs; But all that are killed in battle Awaken to life again: It is lucky that their story Is not known among men. For O, the strong farmers That would let the spade lie, Their hearts would be like a cup That somebody had drunk dry.The little fox he murmured, ‘O what of the world’s bane?’ The sun was laughing sweetly, The moon plucked at my rein; But the little red fox murmured, ‘O do not pluck at his rein, He is riding to the townland That is the world’s bane.’Michael will unhook his trumpet From a bough overhead, And blow a little noise When the supper has been spread. Gabriel will come from the water [84]With a fish tail, and talk Of wonders that have happened On wet roads where men walk, And lift up an old horn Of hammered silver, and drink Till he has fallen asleep Upon the starry brink.The little fox he murmured, ‘O what of the world’s bane?’ The sun was laughing sweetly, The moon plucked at my rein; But the little red fox murmured, ‘O do not pluck at his rein, He is riding to the townland That is the world’s bane.’‘The stars are threshed, and the souls are threshed from their husks.’While I wrought out these fitful Danaan rhymes, My heart would brim with dreams about the times When we bent down above the fading coals; And talked of the dark folk, who live in souls Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees; And of the wayward twilight companies, Who sigh with mingled sorrow and content, [90]Because their blossoming dreams have never bent Under the fruit of evil and of good; And of the embattled flaming multitude Who rise, wing above wing, flame above flame, And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name, And with the clashing of their sword blades make A rapturous music, till the morning break, And the white hush end all, but the loud beat Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet.The woods of Arcady are dead, And over is their antique joy; Of old the world on dreaming fed; Gray Truth is now her painted toy; Yet still she turns her restless head: But O, sick children of the world, Of all the many changing things In dreary dancing past us whirled, To the cracked tune that Chronos sings, Words alone are certain good. Where are now the warring kings, Word bemockers?—By the Rood Where are now the warring kings? An idle word is now their glory, By the stammering schoolboy said, Reading some entangled story: The kings of the old time are fled. The wandering earth herself may be Only a sudden flaming word, In clanging space a moment heard, [92]Troubling the endless reverie. Then no wise worship dusty deeds, Nor seek—for this is also sooth— To hunger fiercely after truth, Lest all thy toiling only breeds New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then, No learning from the starry men, Who follow with the optic glass The whirling ways of stars that pass; Seek, then—for this is also sooth— No word of theirs: the cold star-bane Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain, And dead is all their human truth. Go, gather by the humming sea Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell, And to its lips thy story tell, And they thy comforters will be, Rewording in melodious guile Thy fretful words a little while, Till they shall singing fade in ruth, And die a pearly brotherhood; For words alone are certain good: [93]Sing, then, for this is also sooth. I must be gone: there is a grave Where daffodil and lily wave, And I would please the hapless faun, Buried under the sleepy ground, With mirthful songs before the dawn. His shouting days with mirth were crowned; And still I dream he treads the lawn, Walking ghostly in the dew, Pierced by my glad singing through, My songs of old earth’s dreamy youth: But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou! For fair are poppies on the brow: Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend, And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming, Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming And humming sands, where windy surges wend: And he called loudly to the stars to bend From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they Among themselves laugh on and sing alway: And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story! The sea swept on and cried her old cry still, Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill; He fled the persecution of her glory [95]And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping, Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening, But naught they heard, for they are always listening, The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping. And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend, Sought once again the shore, and found a shell And thought, I will my heavy story tell Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; And my own tale again for me shall sing, And my own whispering words be comforting, And lo! my ancient burden may depart. Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim; But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.He bore her away in his arms, The handsomest young man there, And his neck and his breast and his arms Were drowned in her long dim hair.‘What do you make so fair and bright?’‘I make the cloak of Sorrow: O, lovely to see in all men’s sight Shall be the cloak of Sorrow, In all men’s sight.’‘What do you build with sails for flight?’‘I build a boat for Sorrow, O, swift on the seas all day and night Saileth the rover Sorrow, All day and night.’‘What do you weave with wool so white?’‘I weave the shoes of Sorrow, Soundless shall be the footfall light In all men’s ears of Sorrow, Sudden and light.’Send peace on all the lands and flickering corn.— O, may tranquillity walk by his elbow When wandering in the forest, if he love No other.—Hear, and may the indolent flocks Be plentiful.—And if he love another, May panthers end him.—Hear, and load our king With wisdom hour by hour.—May we two stand, When we are dead, beyond the setting suns, A little from the other shades apart, With mingling hair, and play upon one lute.Hail! hail, my Anashuya.No: be still. I, priestess of this temple, offer up Prayers for the land.I will wait here, Amrita.O’Driscoll scattered the cards And out of his dream awoke: Old men and young men and young girls Were gone like a drifting smoke;By mighty Brahma’s ever rustling robe, Who is Amrita? Sorrow of all sorrows! Another fills your mind.My mother’s name.A sad, sad thought went by me slowly: Sigh, O you little stars! O, sigh and shake your blue apparel! The sad, sad thought has gone from me now wholly: Sing, O you little stars! O sing, and raise your rapturous carol To mighty Brahma, who has made you many as the sands, And laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet hands. Vijaya, I have brought my evening rice; The sun has laid his chin on the gray wood, Weary, with all his poppies gathered round him.The hour when Kama, full of sleepy laughter, Rises, and showers abroad his fragrant arrows, Piercing the twilight with their murmuring barbs.See how the sacred old flamingoes come, Painting with shadow all the marble steps: Aged and wise, they seek their wonted perches Within the temple, devious walking, made To wander by their melancholy minds. Yon tall one eyes my supper; swiftly chase him Far, far away. I named him after you. He is a famous fisher; hour by hour He ruffles with his bill the minnowed streams. Ah! there he snaps my rice. I told you so. Now cuff him off. He’s off! A kiss for you, Because you saved my rice. Have you no thanks?Sing you of her, O first few stars, [100]Whom Brahma, touching with his finger, praises, for you hold The van of wandering quiet; ere you be too calm and old, Sing, turning in your cars, Sing, till you raise your hands and sigh, and from your car heads peer, With all your whirling hair, and drop tear upon azure tear.What know the pilots of the stars of tears?Their faces are all worn, and in their eyes Flashes the fire of sadness, for they see The icicles that famish all the north, Where men lie frozen in the glimmering snow; And in the flaming forests cower the lion And lioness, with all their whimpering cubs; And, ever pacing on the verge of things, The phantom, Beauty, in a mist of tears; While we alone have round us woven woods, And feel the softness of each other’s hand, Amrita, while—Ah me, you love another, And may some dreadful ill befall her quick!I loved another; now I love no other. Among the mouldering of ancient woods You live, and on the village border she, With her old father the blind wood-cutter; I saw her standing in her door but now.But he heard high up in the air A piper piping away, And never was piping so sad, And never was piping so gay.Vijaya, swear to love her never more.Ay, ay.Swear by the parents of the gods, Dread oath, who dwell on sacred Himalay, On the far Golden Peak; enormous shapes, Who still were old when the great sea was young; On their vast faces mystery and dreams; Their hair along the mountains rolled and filled From year to year by the unnumbered nests Of aweless birds, and round their stirless feet The joyous flocks of deer and antelope, Who never hear the unforgiving hound. Swear!By the parents of the gods, I swear.I have forgiven, O new star! Maybe you have not heard of us, you have come forth so newly, You hunter of the fields afar! Ah, you will know my loved one by his hunter’s arrows truly, Shoot on him shafts of quietness, that he may ever keep An inner laughter, and may kiss his hands to me in sleep.Farewell, Vijaya. Nay, no word, no word; I, priestess of this temple, offer up Prayers for the land. O Brahma, guard in sleep The merry lambs and the complacent kine, The flies below the leaves, and the young mice In the tree roots, and all the sacred flocks Of red flamingo; and my love, Vijaya; And may no restless fay with fidget finger Trouble his sleeping: give him dreams of me.I passed along the water’s edge below the humid trees, My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my knees, My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak: Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky. The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from his eye. I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk: Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk, [104]For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide. A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes Brimful of starlight, and he said: The Stamper of the Skies, He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me? I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say: Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay, He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light.The island dreams under the dawn And great boughs drop tranquillity; The peahens dance on a smooth lawn, A parrot sways upon a tree, Raging at his own image in the enamelled sea.Here we will moor our lonely ship And wander ever with woven hands, Murmuring softly lip to lip, Along the grass, along the sands, Murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands:How we alone of mortals are Hid under quiet boughs apart, While our love grows an Indian star, A meteor of the burning heart, [106]One with the tide that gleams, the wings that gleam and dart,Although you hide in the ebb and flow Of the pale tide when the moon has set, The people of coming days will know About the casting out of my net, And how you have leaped times out of mind Over the little silver cords, And think that you were hard and unkind, And blame you with many bitter words.The heavy boughs, the burnished dove That moans and sighs a hundred days: How when we die our shades will rove, When eve has hushed the feathered ways, Dropping a vapoury footsole on the tide’s drowsy blaze.Autumn is over the long leaves that love us, And over the mice in the barley sheaves; Yellow the leaves of the rowan above us, And yellow the wet wild-strawberry leaves.The hour of the waning of love has beset us, And weary and worn are our sad souls now; Let us part, ere the season of passion forget us, With a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow.‘Your eyes that once were never weary of mine Are bowed in sorrow under their trembling lids, Because our love is waning.’And then she: ‘Although our love is waning, let us stand By the lone border of the lake once more, Together in that hour of gentleness When the poor tired child, Passion, falls asleep: How far away the stars seem, and how far Is our first kiss, and ah, how old my heart!’ Pensive they paced along the faded leaves, While slowly he whose hand held hers replied: [108]‘Passion has often worn our wandering hearts.’The woods were round them, and the yellow leaves Fell like faint meteors in the gloom, and once A rabbit old and lame limped down the path; Autumn was over him: and now they stood On the lone border of the lake once more: Turning, he saw that she had thrust dead leaves Gathered in silence, dewy as her eyes, In bosom and hair. ‘Ah, do not mourn,’ he said, ‘That we are tired, for other loves await us: Hate on and love through unrepining hours; Before us lies eternity; our souls Are love, and a continual farewell.’I sat on cushioned otter skin: My word was law from Ith to Emen, And shook at Invar Amargin The hearts of the world-troubling seamen, And drove tumult and war away From girl and boy and man and beast; The fields grew fatter day by day, The wild fowl of the air increased; And every ancient Ollave said, While he bent down his fading head, ‘He drives away the Northern cold.’ They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.I sat and mused and drank sweet wine; A herdsman came from inland valleys, Crying, the pirates drove his swine To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys. I called my battle-breaking men, [110]And my loud brazen battle-cars From rolling vale and rivery glen; And under the blinking of the stars Fell on the pirates by the deep, And hurled them in the gulph of sleep: These hands won many a torque of gold. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.But slowly, as I shouting slew And trampled in the bubbling mire, In my most secret spirit grew A whirling and a wandering fire: I stood: keen stars above me shone, Around me shone keen eyes of men: I laughed aloud and hurried on By rocky shore and rushy fen; I laughed because birds fluttered by, And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high, And rushes waved and waters rolled. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.And now I wander in the woods When summer gluts the golden bees, Or in autumnal solitudes Arise the leopard-coloured trees; Or when along the wintry strands [111]The cormorants shiver on their rocks; I wander on, and wave my hands, And sing, and shake my heavy locks. The grey wolf knows me; by one ear I lead along the woodland deer; The hares run by me growing bold. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.The Danaan children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold, And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes, For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies, With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold: I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast, And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me. Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea; Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West; Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost; O heart the winds have shaken; the unappeasable host Is comelier than candles at Mother Mary’s feet.I came upon a little town, That slumbered in the harvest moon, And passed a-tiptoe up and down, Murmuring, to a fitful tune, How I have followed, night and day, A tramping of tremendous feet, And saw where this old tympan lay, Deserted on a doorway seat, And bore it to the woods with me; Of some unhuman misery Our married voices wildly trolled. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.I sang how, when day’s toil is done, Orchil shakes out her long dark hair That hides away the dying sun And sheds faint odours through the air: When my hand passed from wire to wire [112]It quenched, with sound like falling dew, The whirling and the wandering fire; But lift a mournful ulalu, For the kind wires are torn and still, And I must wander wood and hill Through summer’s heat and winter’s cold. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.Where dips the rocky highland Of Sleuth Wood in the lake, There lies a leafy island Where flapping herons wake The drowsy water rats; There we’ve hid our faery vats. Full of berries, And of reddest stolen cherries. Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.Where the wave of moonlight glosses The dim gray sands with light, Far off by furthest Rosses [114]We foot it all the night, Weaving olden dances, Mingling hands and mingling glances Till the moon has taken flight; To and fro we leap And chase the frothy bubbles, While the world is full of troubles And is anxious in its sleep. Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.Where the wandering water gushes From the hills above Glen-Car, In pools among the rushes That scarce could bathe a star, We seek for slumbering trout, And whispering in their ears Give them unquiet dreams; Leaning softly out From ferns that drop their tears Over the young streams. Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, [115]For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.Away with us he’s going, The solemn-eyed: He’ll hear no more the lowing Of the calves on the warm hillside; Or the kettle on the hob Sing peace into his breast, Or see the brown mice bob Round and round the oatmeal-chest. For he comes, the human child, To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, From a world more full of weeping than he can understand.Shy one, shy one, Shy one of my heart, She moves in the firelight Pensively apart.She carries in the dishes, And lays them in a row. To an isle in the water With her would I go.She carries in the candles And lights the curtained room, Shy in the doorway And shy in the gloom;And shy as a rabbit, Helpful and shy. To an isle in the water With her would I fly.Out-worn heart, in a time out-worn, Come clear of the nets of wrong and right; Laugh, heart, again in the gray twilight, Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet; She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet. She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree; But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.In a field by the river my love and I did stand, And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand. She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs; But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.You waves, though you dance by my feet like children at play, Though you glow and you glance, though you purr and you dart; In the Junes that were warmer than these are, the waves were more gay, When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.The herring are not in the tides as they were of old; My sorrow! for many a creak gave the creel in the cart That carried the take to Sligo town to be sold, When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.And ah, you proud maiden, you are not so fair when his oar Is heard on the water, as they were, the proud and apart, Who paced in the eve by the nets on the pebbly shore, When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.Good Father John O’Hart In penal days rode out To a shoneen who had free lands And his own snipe and trout.In trust took he John’s lands; Sleiveens were all his race; And he gave them as dowers to his daughters, And they married beyond their place.But Father John went up, And Father John went down; And he wore small holes in his shoes, And he wore large holes in his gown.All loved him, only the shoneen, Whom the devils have by the hair, From the wives, and the cats, and the children, To the birds in the white of the air.The birds, for he opened their cages As he went up and down; And he said with a smile, ‘Have peace now’; [120]And he went his way with a frown.O sweet everlasting Voices, be still; Go to the guards of the heavenly fold And bid them wander obeying your will Flame under flame, till Time be no more; Have you not heard that our hearts are old, That you call in birds, in wind on the hill, In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore? O sweet everlasting Voices, be still.Your mother Eire is always young, Dew ever shining and twilight gray; Though hope fall from you and love decay, Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.But if when any one died Came keeners hoarser than rooks, He bade them give over their keening; For he was a man of books.And these were the works of John, When weeping score by score, People came into Coloony; For he’d died at ninety-four.There was no human keening; The birds from Knocknarea And the world round Knocknashee Came keening in that day.The young birds and old birds Came flying, heavy and sad; Keening in from Tiraragh, Keening from Ballinafad;Keening from Inishmurray, Nor stayed for bite or sup; This way were all reproved Who dig old customs up.Come round me, little childer; There, don’t fling stones at me Because I mutter as I go; But pity Moll Magee.My man was a poor fisher With shore lines in the say; My work was saltin’ herrings The whole of the long day.And sometimes from the saltin’ shed, I scarce could drag my feet Under the blessed moonlight, Along the pebbly street.I’d always been but weakly, And my baby was just born; A neighbour minded her by day, I minded her till morn.I lay upon my baby; Ye little childer dear, I looked on my cold baby [122]When the morn grew frosty and clear.Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill For there the mystical brotherhood Of sun and moon and hollow and wood And river and stream work out their will;A weary woman sleeps so hard! My man grew red and pale, And gave me money, and bade me go To my own place, Kinsale.He drove me out and shut the door, And gave his curse to me; I went away in silence, No neighbour could I see.The windows and the doors were shut, One star shone faint and green; The little straws were turnin’ round Across the bare boreen.I went away in silence: Beyond old Martin’s byre I saw a kindly neighbour Blowin’ her mornin’ fire.She drew from me my story— My money’s all used up, And still, with pityin’, scornin’ eye, She gives me bite and sup.She says my man will surely come, And fetch me home agin; But always, as I’m movin’ round, [123]Without doors or within,Pilin’ the wood or pilin’ the turf, Or goin’ to the well, I’m thinkin’ of my baby And keenin’ to mysel’.And sometimes I am sure she knows When, openin’ wide His door, God lights the stars, His candles, And looks upon the poor.So now, ye little childer, Ye won’t fling stones at me; But gather with your shinin’ looks And pity Moll Magee.‘Now lay me in a cushioned chair And carry me, you four, With cushions here and cushions there, To see the world once more.And God stands winding His lonely horn, And time and the world are ever in flight; And love is less kind than the gray twilight And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.‘And some one from the stables bring My Dermot dear and brown, And lead him gently in a ring, And gently up and down.‘Now leave the chair upon the grass: Bring hound and huntsman here, And I on this strange road will pass, Filled full of ancient cheer.’His eyelids droop, his head falls low, His old eyes cloud with dreams; The sun upon all things that grow Pours round in sleepy streams.Brown Dermot treads upon the lawn, [125]And to the armchair goes, And now the old man’s dreams are gone, He smooths the long brown nose.And now moves many a pleasant tongue Upon his wasted hands, For leading aged hounds and young The huntsman near him stands.‘My huntsman, Rody, blow the horn, And make the hills reply.’ The huntsman loosens on the morn A gay and wandering cry.A fire is in the old man’s eyes, His fingers move and sway, And when the wandering music dies They hear him feebly say,‘My huntsman, Rody, blow the horn, And make the hills reply.’ ‘I cannot blow upon my horn, I can but weep and sigh.’The servants round his cushioned place Are with new sorrow wrung; And hounds are gazing on his face, [126]Both aged hounds and young.One blind hound only lies apart On the sun-smitten grass; He holds deep commune with his heart: The moments pass and pass;I went out to the hazel wood, Because a fire was in my head, And cut and peeled a hazel wand, And hooked a berry to a thread; And when white moths were on the wing, And moth-like stars were flickering out, I dropped the berry in a stream And caught a little silver trout.The blind hound with a mournful din Lifts slow his wintry head; The servants bear the body in; The hounds wail for the dead.The old priest Peter Gilligan Was weary night and day; For half his flock were in their beds, Or under green sods lay.Once, while he nodded on a chair, At the moth-hour of eve, Another poor man sent for him, And he began to grieve.‘I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace, For people die and die’; And after cried he, ‘God forgive! My body spake, not I!’He knelt, and leaning on the chair He prayed and fell asleep; And the moth-hour went from the fields, And stars began to peep.They slowly into millions grew, [128]And leaves shook in the wind; And God covered the world with shade, And whispered to mankind.Upon the time of sparrow chirp When the moths came once more, The old priest Peter Gilligan Stood upright on the floor.‘Mavrone, mavrone! the man has died, While I slept on the chair’; He roused his horse out of its sleep, And rode with little care.He rode now as he never rode, By rocky lane and fen; The sick man’s wife opened the door: ‘Father! you come again!’‘And is the poor man dead?’ he cried. ‘He died an hour ago.’ The old priest Peter Gilligan In grief swayed to and fro.When I had laid it on the floor I went to blow the fire a-flame, But something rustled on the floor, And someone called me by my name: It had become a glimmering girl With apple blossom in her hair Who called me by my name and ran [12]And faded through the brightening air.‘When you were gone, he turned and died As merry as a bird.’ The old priest Peter Gilligan [129]He knelt him at that word.‘He who hath made the night of stars For souls, who tire and bleed, Sent one of His great angels down To help me in my need.‘He who is wrapped in purple robes, With planets in His care, Had pity on the least of things Asleep upon a chair.’I had a chair at every hearth, When no one turned to see, With ‘Look at that old fellow there, And who may he be?’ And therefore do I wander now, And the fret lies on me.The road-side trees keep murmuring: Ah, wherefore murmur ye, As in the old days long gone by, Green oak and poplar tree? The well-known faces are all gone And the fret lies on me.When I play on my fiddle in Dooney, Folk dance like a wave of the sea; My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet, My brother in Moharabuiee.I passed my brother and cousin: They read in their books of prayer; I read in my book of songs I bought at the Sligo fair.When we come at the end of time, To Peter sitting in state, He will smile on the three old spirits, But call me first through the gate;For the good are always the merry, Save by an evil chance, And the merry love the fiddle And the merry love to dance:And when the folk there spy me, They will all come up to me, With ‘Here is the fiddler of Dooney!’ And dance like a wave of the sea.Though I am old with wandering Through hollow lands and hilly lands, I will find out where she has gone, And kiss her lips and take her hands; And walk among long dappled grass, And pluck till time and times are done The silver apples of the moon, The golden apples of the sun.There was a green branch hung with many a bell When her own people ruled in wave-worn Eire; And from its murmuring greenness, calm of faery, A Druid kindness, on all hearers fell.It charmed away the merchant from his guile, And turned the farmer’s memory from his cattle, And hushed in sleep the roaring ranks of battle, For all who heard it dreamed a little while.Ah, Exiles, wandering over many seas, Spinning at all times Eire’s good to-morrow! Ah, worldwide Nation, always growing Sorrow! I also bear a bell branch full of ease.I tore it from green boughs winds tossed and hurled, [133]Green boughs of tossing always, weary, weary! I tore it from the green boughs of old Eire, The willow of the many-sorrowed world.Ah, Exiles, wandering over many lands! My bell branch murmurs: the gay bells bring laughter, Leaping to shake a cobweb from the rafter; The sad bells bow the forehead on the hands.A honeyed ringing: under the new skies They bring you memories of old village faces; Cabins gone now, old well-sides, old dear places; And men who loved the cause that never dies.‘Sero te amavi, Pulchritudo tam antiqua et tam nova! Sero te amavi.’Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days! Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways: Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide; The Druid, gray, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed, Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold; And thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown old In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea, Sing in their high and lonely melody. Come near, that no more blinded by man’s fate, I find under the boughs of love and hate, In all poor foolish things that live a day, Eternal beauty wandering on her way.Come near, come near, come near—Ah, leave me still A little space for the rose-breath to fill! Lest I no more hear common things that crave; The weak worm hiding down in its small cave, [140]The field mouse running by me in the grass, And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass; But seek alone to hear the strange things said By God to the bright hearts of those long dead, And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know. Come near; I would, before my time to go, Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways: Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days.The whole day have I followed in the rocks, And you have changed and flowed from shape to shape. First as a raven on whose ancient wings Scarcely a feather lingered, then you seemed A weasel moving on from stone to stone, And now at last you wear a human shape, A thin gray man half lost in gathering night.O what to me the little room That was brimmed up with prayer and rest; He bade me out into the gloom, And my breast lies upon his breast.What would you, king of the proud Red Branch kings?This would I say, most wise of living souls: Young subtle Conchubar sat close by me When I gave judgment, and his words were wise, And what to me was burden without end To him seemed easy, so I laid the crown Upon his head to cast away my care.What would you, king of the proud Red Branch kings?I feast amid my people on the hill, And pace the woods, and drive my chariot wheels In the white border of the murmuring sea; And still I feel the crown upon my head.What would you, king of the proud Red Branch kings?I’d put away the foolish might of a king, But learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours.Look on my thin gray hair and hollow cheeks, And on these hands that may not lift the sword, This body trembling like a wind-blown reed. No maiden loves me, no man seeks my help, Because I be not of the things I dream.A wild and foolish labourer is a king, To do and do and do, and never dream.Take, if you must, this little bag of dreams; Unloose the cord, and they will wrap you round.I see my life go dripping like a stream From change to change; I have been many things, A green drop in the surge, a gleam of light Upon a sword, a fir-tree on a hill, An old slave grinding at a heavy quern, A king sitting upon a chair of gold, And all these things were wonderful and great; But now I have grown nothing, being all, And the whole world weighs down upon my heart: Ah! Druid, Druid, how great webs of sorrow Lay hidden in the small slate-coloured thing!O what to me my mother’s care, The house where I was safe and warm; The shadowy blossom of my hair Will hide us from the bitter storm.A man came slowly from the setting sun, To Forgail’s daughter, Emer, in her dun, And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care, And said, casting aside his draggled hair: ‘I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour-hid; But now my years of watching are no more.’Then Emer cast the web upon the floor, And stretching out her arms, red with the dye, Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said: ‘Not any god alive, nor mortal dead, Has slain so mighty armies, so great kings, Nor won the gold that now Cuchulain brings.’‘Why do you tremble thus from feet to crown?’Aleel, the swineherd, wept and cast him down Upon the web-heaped floor, and thus his word: ‘With him is one sweet-throated like a bird, And lovelier than the moon upon the sea; [145]He made for her an army cease to be.’‘Who bade you tell these things?’ and then she cried To those about, ‘Beat him with thongs of hide And drive him from the door.’ And thus it was; And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet, And called out to him, ‘Son, it is not meet That you stay idling here with flocks and herds.’‘I have long waited, mother, for those words; But wherefore now?’‘There is a man to die; You have the heaviest arm under the sky.’‘My father dwells among the sea-worn bands, And breaks the ridge of battle with his hands.’‘Nay, you are taller than Cuchulain, son.’O hiding hair and dewy eyes, I am no more with life and death, My heart upon his warm heart lies, My breath is mixed into his breath.‘He is the mightiest man in ship or dun.’‘Nay, he is old and sad with many wars, And weary of the crash of battle cars.’‘I only ask what way my journey lies, [146]For God, who made you bitter, made you wise.’‘The Red Branch kings a tireless banquet keep, Where the sun falls into the Western deep. Go there, and dwell on the green forest rim; But tell alone your name and house to him Whose blade compels, and bid them send you one Who has a like vow from their triple dun.’Between the lavish shelter of a wood And the gray tide, the Red Branch multitude Feasted, and with them old Cuchulain dwelt, And his young dear one close beside him knelt, And gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes, More mournful than the depth of starry skies, And pondered on the wonder of his days; And all around the harp-string told his praise, And Conchubar, the Red Branch king of kings, With his own fingers touched the brazen strings. At last Cuchulain spake, ‘A young man strays Driving the deer along the woody ways. I often hear him singing to and fro; I often hear the sweet sound of his bow, Seek out what man he is.’One went and came. ‘He bade me let all know he gives his name At the sword point, and bade me bring him one [147]Who had a like vow from our triple dun.’‘I only of the Red Branch hosted now,’ Cuchulain cried, ‘have made and keep that vow.’After short fighting in the leafy shade, He spake to the young man, ‘Is there no maid Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round, Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground, That you come here to meet this ancient sword?’‘The dooms of men are in God’s hidden hoard.’‘Your head a while seemed like a woman’s head That I loved once.’Pale brows, still hands and dim hair, I had a beautiful friend And dreamed that the old despair Would end in love in the end: She looked in my heart one day And saw your image was there; She has gone weeping away.Again the fighting sped, But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke, And through the other’s shield his long blade broke, And pierced him.‘Speak before your breath is done.’‘I am Finmole, mighty Cuchulain’s son.’[148]‘I put you from your pain. I can no more.’While day its burden on to evening bore, With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed; Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid, And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed; In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast. Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men, Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten, Spake thus, ‘Cuchulain will dwell there and brood For three days more in dreadful quietude, And then arise, and raving slay us all. Go, cast on him delusions magical, That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.’ And ten by ten under a quicken tree, The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands Tall wands of alder and white quicken wands.In three days’ time, Cuchulain with a moan Stood up, and came to the long sands alone: For four days warred he with the bitter tide; And the waves flowed above him, and he died.Who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream? For these red lips, with all their mournful pride, Mournful that no new wonder may betide, Troy passed away in one high funeral gleam, And Usna’s children died.We and the labouring world are passing by: Amid men’s souls, that waver and give place, Like the pale waters in their wintry race, Under the passing stars, foam of the sky, Lives on this lonely face.Bow down, archangels, in your dim abode: Before you were, or any hearts to beat, Weary and kind one lingered by His seat; He made the world to be a grassy road Before her wandering feet.If Michael, leader of God’s host When Heaven and Hell are met, Looked down on you from Heaven’s door-post He would his deeds forget.Time drops in decay, Like a candle burnt out, And the mountains and woods Have their day, have their day; What one in the rout Of the fire-born moods Has fallen away?Do you not hear me calling, white deer with no horns! I have been changed to a hound with one red ear; I have been in the Path of Stones and the Wood of Thorns, For somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear Under my feet that they follow you night and day. A man with a hazel wand came without sound; He changed me suddenly; I was looking another way; And now my calling is but the calling of a hound; [16]And Time and Birth and Change are hurrying by. I would that the Boar without bristles had come from the West And had rooted the sun and moon and stars out of the sky And lay in the darkness, grunting, and turning to his rest.Brooding no more upon God’s wars In his Divine homestead, He would go weave out of the stars A chaplet for your head.And all folk seeing him bow down, And white stars tell your praise, Would come at last to God’s great town, Led on by gentle ways;And God would bid His warfare cease, Saying all things were well; And softly make a rosy peace, A peace of Heaven with Hell.Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World! The tall thought-woven sails, that flap unfurled Above the tide of hours, trouble the air, And God’s bell buoyed to be the water’s care; While hushed from fear, or loud with hope, a band With blown, spray-dabbled hair gather at hand. Turn if you may from battles never done, I call, as they go by me one by one, Danger no refuge holds, and war no peace, For him who hears love sing and never cease, Beside her clean-swept hearth, her quiet shade: But gather all for whom no love hath made A woven silence, or but came to cast A song into the air, and singing past To smile on the pale dawn; and gather you Who have sought more than is in rain or dew Or in the sun and moon, or on the earth, Or sighs amid the wandering, starry mirth, Or comes in laughter from the sea’s sad lips; And wage God’s battles in the long gray ships. [152]The sad, the lonely, the insatiable, To these Old Night shall all her mystery tell; God’s bell has claimed them by the little cry Of their sad hearts, that may not live nor die.Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World! You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing. Beauty grown sad with its eternity Made you of us, and of the dim gray sea. Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait, For God has bid them share an equal fate; And when at last defeated in His wars, They have gone down under the same white stars, We shall no longer hear the little cry Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die.We who are old, old and gay, O so old! Thousands of years, thousands of years, If all were told:Give to these children, new from the world, Silence and love; And the long dew-dropping hours of the night, And the stars above:Give to these children, new from the world, Rest far from men. Is anything better, anything better? Tell us it then:Us who are old, old and gay, O so old! Thousands of years, thousands of years, If all were told.I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, And live alone in the bee-loud glade.I hear the Shadowy Horses, their long manes a-shake, Their hoofs heavy with tumult, their eyes glimmering white; The North unfolds above them clinging, creeping night, The East her hidden joy before the morning break, The West weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away, The South is pouring down roses of crimson fire: O vanity of Sleep, Hope, Dream, endless Desire, The Horses of Disaster plunge in the heavy clay: Beloved, let your eyes half close, and your heart beat Over my heart, and your hair fall over my breast, Drowning love’s lonely hour in deep twilight of rest, And hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet.And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evening full of the linnet’s wings.I will arise and go now, for always night and day I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray, I hear it in the deep heart’s core.The angels are stooping Above your bed; They weary of trooping With the whimpering dead.God’s laughing in heaven To see you so good; The shining Seven Are gay with His mood.I kiss you and kiss you, My pigeon, my own; Ah, how I shall miss you When you have grown.I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow; And then I must scrub and bake and sweep Till stars are beginning to blink and peep; And the young lie long and dream in their bed Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head, And their day goes over in idleness, And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress: While I must work because I am old, And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.A pity beyond all telling Is hid in the heart of love: The folk who are buying and selling; The clouds on their journey above; The cold wet winds ever blowing; And the shadowy hazel grove Where mouse-gray waters are flowing Threaten the head that I love.The quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves, The full round moon and the star-laden sky, And the loud song of the ever-singing leaves, Had hid away earth’s old and weary cry.And then you came with those red mournful lips, And with you came the whole of the world’s tears, And all the trouble of her labouring ships, And all the trouble of her myriad years.And now the sparrows warring in the eaves, The curd-pale moon, the white stars in the sky, And the loud chaunting of the unquiet leaves, Are shaken with earth’s old and weary cry.O, curlew, cry no more in the air, Or only to the waters in the West; Because your crying brings to my mind Passion-dimmed eyes and long heavy hair That was shaken out over my breast: There is enough evil in the crying of wind.When you are old and gray and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true; But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face.And bending down beside the glowing bars Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.I would that we were, my beloved, white birds on the foam of the sea! We tire of the flame of the meteor, before it can fade and flee; And the flame of the blue star of twilight, hung low on the rim of the sky, Has awaked in our hearts, my beloved, a sadness that may not die.A weariness comes from those dreamers, dew-dabbled, the lily and rose; Ah, dream not of them, my beloved, the flame of the meteor that goes, Or the flame of the blue star that lingers hung low in the fall of the dew: [160]For I would we were changed to white birds on the wandering foam: I and you!I am haunted by numberless islands, and many a Danaan shore, Where Time would surely forget us, and Sorrow come near us no more; Soon far from the rose and the lily, and fret of the flames would we be, Were we only white birds, my beloved, buoyed out on the foam of the sea!I dreamed that one had died in a strange place Near no accustomed hand: And they had nailed the boards above her face, The peasants of that land, And, wondering, planted by her solitude A cypress and a yew: I came, and wrote upon a cross of wood, Man had no more to do: She was more beautiful than thy first love, This lady by the trees: And gazed upon the mournful stars above, And heard the mournful breeze.All the heavy days are over; Leave the body’s coloured pride Underneath the grass and clover, With the feet laid side by side.One with her are mirth and duty; Bear the gold embroidered dress, For she needs not her sad beauty, To the scented oaken press.Hers the kiss of Mother Mary, The long hair is on her face; Still she goes with footsteps wary, Full of earth’s old timid grace.When my arms wrap you round I press My heart upon the loveliness That has long faded from the world; The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled In shadowy pools, when armies fled; The love-tales wrought with silken thread By dreaming ladies upon cloth That has made fat the murderous moth; The roses that of old time were Woven by ladies in their hair, The dew-cold lilies ladies bore Through many a sacred corridor Where such gray clouds of incense rose That only the gods’ eyes did not close: For that pale breast and lingering hand Come from a more dream-heavy land, A more dream-heavy hour than this; And when you sigh from kiss to kiss I hear white Beauty sighing, too, For hours when all must fade like dew, All but the flames, and deep on deep, Throne over throne where in half sleep, Their swords upon their iron knees, Brood her high lonely mysteries.With white feet of angels seven Her white feet go glimmering; And above the deep of heaven, Flame on flame and wing on wing.He stood among a crowd at Drumahair; His heart hung all upon a silken dress, And he had known at last some tenderness, Before earth made of him her sleepy care; But when a man poured fish into a pile, It seemed they raised their little silver heads, And sang how day a Druid twilight sheds Upon a dim, green, well-beloved isle, Where people love beside star-laden seas; How Time may never mar their faery vows Under the woven roofs of quicken boughs: The singing shook him out of his new ease.He wandered by the sands of Lisadill; His mind ran all on money cares and fears, And he had known at last some prudent years Before they heaped his grave under the hill; But while he passed before a plashy place, A lug-worm with its gray and muddy mouth Sang how somewhere to north or west or south There dwelt a gay, exulting, gentle race; And how beneath those three times blessed skies [164]A Danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons, And as it falls awakens leafy tunes: And at that singing he was no more wise.He mused beside the well of Scanavin, He mused upon his mockers: without fail His sudden vengeance were a country tale, Now that deep earth has drunk his body in; But one small knot-grass growing by the pool Told where, ah, little, all-unneeded voice! Old Silence bids a lonely folk rejoice, And chaplet their calm brows with leafage cool; And how, when fades the sea-strewn rose of day, A gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece, And all their trouble dies into its peace: The tale drove his fine angry mood away.He slept under the hill of Lugnagall; And might have known at last unhaunted sleep Under that cold and vapour-turbaned steep, Now that old earth had taken man and all: Were not the worms that spired about his bones A-telling with their low and reedy cry, Of how God leans His hands out of the sky, To bless that isle with honey in His tones; That none may feel the power of squall and wave, And no one any leaf-crowned dancer miss Until He burn up Nature with a kiss: The man has found no comfort in the grave.Beloved, gaze in thine own heart, The holy tree is growing there; From joy the holy branches start, And all the trembling flowers they bear. The changing colours of its fruit Have dowered the stars with merry light; The surety of its hidden root Has planted quiet in the night; The shaking of its leafy head Has given the waves their melody, And made my lips and music wed, Murmuring a wizard song for thee. There, through bewildered branches, go Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife, Tossing and tossing to and fro The flaming circle of our life. When looking on their shaken hair, And dreaming how they dance and dart, Thine eyes grow full of tender care: [166]Beloved, gaze in thine own heart. Gaze no more in the bitter glass The demons, with their subtle guile, Lift up before us when they pass, Or only gaze a little while; For there a fatal image grows, With broken boughs, and blackened leaves, And roots half hidden under snows Driven by a storm that ever grieves. For all things turn to barrenness In the dim glass the demons hold, The glass of outer weariness, Made when God slept in times of old. There, through the broken branches, go The ravens of unresting thought; Peering and flying to and fro, To see men’s souls bartered and bought. When they are heard upon the wind, And when they shake their wings; alas! Thy tender eyes grow all unkind: Gaze no more in the bitter glass.Know, that I would accounted be True brother of that company, Who sang to sweeten Ireland’s wrong, Ballad and story, rann and song; Nor be I any less of them, Because the red-rose-bordered hem Of her, whose history began Before God made the angelic clan, Trails all about the written page; For in the world’s first blossoming age The light fall of her flying feet Made Ireland’s heart begin to beat; And still the starry candles flare To help her light foot here and there; And still the thoughts of Ireland brood Upon her holy quietude.Nor may I less be counted one With Davis, Mangan, Ferguson, Because to him, who ponders well, My rhymes more than their rhyming tell Of the dim wisdoms old and deep, [168]That God gives unto man in sleep. For the elemental beings go About my table to and fro. In flood and fire and clay and wind, They huddle from man’s pondering mind; Yet he who treads in austere ways May surely meet their ancient gaze. Man ever journeys on with them After the red-rose-bordered hem. Ah, faeries, dancing under the moon, A Druid land, a Druid tune!While still I may, I write for you The love I lived, the dream I knew. From our birthday, until we die, Is but the winking of an eye; And we, our singing and our love, The mariners of night above, And all the wizard things that go About my table to and fro, Are passing on to where may be, In truth’s consuming ecstasy, No place for love and dream at all; For God goes by with white foot-fall. I cast my heart into my rhymes, That you, in the dim coming times, May know how my heart went with them After the red-rose-bordered hem.‘Give me the world if Thou wilt, but grant me an asylum for my affections.’I bring you with reverent hands The books of my numberless dreams; White woman that passion has worn As the tide wears the dove-gray sands, And with heart more old than the horn That is brimmed from the pale fire of time: White woman with numberless dreams I bring you my passionate rhyme.You who are bent, and bald, and blind, With a heavy heart and a wandering mind, Have known three centuries, poets sing, Of dalliance with a demon thing.Sad to remember, sick with years, The swift innumerable spears, The horsemen with their floating hair, And bowls of barley, honey, and wine, And feet of maidens dancing in tune, And the white body that lay by mine; But the tale, though words be lighter than air, Must live to be old like the wandering moon.Caolte, and Conan, and Finn were there, [176]When we followed a deer with our baying hounds, With Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair, And passing the Firbolgs’ burial mounds, Came to the cairn-heaped grassy hill Where passionate Maeve is stony still; And found on the dove-gray edge of the sea A pearl-pale, high-born lady, who rode On a horse with bridle of findrinny; And like a sunset were her lips, A stormy sunset on doomed ships; A citron colour gloomed in her hair, But down to her feet white vesture flowed, And with the glimmering crimson glowed Of many a figured embroidery; And it was bound with a pearl-pale shell That wavered like the summer streams, As her soft bosom rose and fell. You are still wrecked among heathen dreams.‘Why do you wind no horn?’ she said. ‘And every hero droop his head? The hornless deer is not more sad That many a peaceful moment had, More sleek than any granary mouse, [177]In his own leafy forest house Among the waving fields of fern: The hunting of heroes should be glad.’‘O pleasant maiden,’ answered Finn, ‘We think on Oscar’s pencilled urn, And on the heroes lying slain, On Gavra’s raven-covered plain; But where are your noble kith and kin, And into what country do you ride?’‘My father and my mother are Aengus and Edain, and my name Is Niamh, and my land where tide And sleep drown sun and moon and star.’‘What dream came with you that you came To this dim shore on foam-wet feet? Did your companion wander away From where the birds of Aengus wing?’She said, with laughter tender and sweet: ‘I have not yet, war-weary king, Been spoken of with any one; For love of Oisin foam-wet feet Have borne me where the tempests blind Your mortal shores till time is done!’[178]‘How comes it, princess, that your mind Among undying people has run On this young man, Oisin, my son?’‘I loved no man, though kings besought And many a man of lofty name, Until the Danaan poets came, Bringing me honeyed, wandering thought Of noble Oisin and his fame, Of battles broken by his hands, Of stories builded by his words That are like coloured Asian birds At evening in their rainless lands.’Fasten your hair with a golden pin, And bind up every wandering tress; I bade my heart build these poor rhymes: It worked at them, day out, day in, Building a sorrowful loveliness Out of the battles of old times.O Patric, by your brazen bell, There was no limb of mine but fell Into a desperate gulph of love! ‘You only will I wed,’ I cried, ‘And I will make a thousand songs, And set your name all names above, And captives bound with leathern thongs Shall kneel and praise you, one by one, At evening in my western dun.’‘O Oisin, mount by me and ride To shores by the wash of the tremulous tide, Where men have heaped no burial mounds, And the days pass by like a wayward tune, [179]Where broken faith has never been known, And the blushes of first love never have flown; And there I will give you a hundred hounds; No mightier creatures bay at the moon; And a hundred robes of murmuring silk, And a hundred calves and a hundred sheep Whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows, And a hundred spears and a hundred bows, And oil and wine and honey and milk, And always never-anxious sleep; While a hundred youths, mighty of limb, But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife, And a hundred maidens, merry as birds, Who when they dance to a fitful measure Have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds, Shall follow your horn and obey your whim, And you shall know the Danaan leisure: And Niamh be with you for a wife.’ Then she sighed gently, ‘It grows late, Music and love and sleep await, Where I would be when the white moon climbs, The red sun falls, and the world grows dim.’And then I mounted and she bound me With her triumphing arms around me, And whispering to herself enwound me; But when the horse had felt my weight, He shook himself and neighed three times: [180]Caolte, Conan, and Finn came near, And wept, and raised their lamenting hands, And bid me stay, with many a tear; But we rode out from the human lands.In what far kingdom do you go, Ah, Fenians, with the shield and bow? Or are you phantoms white as snow, Whose lips had life’s most prosperous glow? O you, with whom in sloping valleys, Or down the dewy forest alleys, I chased at morn the flying deer, With whom I hurled the hurrying spear, And heard the foemen’s bucklers rattle, And broke the heaving ranks of battle! And Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair, Where are you with your long rough hair? You go not where the red deer feeds, Nor tear the foemen from their steeds.Boast not, nor mourn with drooping head Companions long accurst and dead, And hounds for centuries dust and air.We galloped over the glossy sea: [181]I know not if days passed or hours, And Niamh sang continually Danaan songs, and their dewy showers Of pensive laughter, unhuman sound, Lulled weariness, and softly round My human sorrow her white arms wound.On! on! and now a hornless deer Passed by us, chased by a phantom hound All pearly white, save one red ear; And now a maiden rode like the wind With an apple of gold in her tossing hand, And with quenchless eyes and fluttering hair A beautiful young man followed behind.‘Were these two born in the Danaan land, Or have they breathed the mortal air?’‘Vex them no longer,’ Niamh said, And sighing bowed her gentle head, And sighing laid the pearly tip Of one long finger on my lip.But now the moon like a white rose shone In the pale west, and the sun’s rim sank, And clouds arrayed their rank on rank About his fading crimson ball: The floor of Emen’s hosting hall [182]Was not more level than the sea, As full of loving phantasy, And with low murmurs we rode on, Where many a trumpet-twisted shell That in immortal silence sleeps Dreaming of her own melting hues, Her golds, her ambers, and her blues, Pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps. But now a wandering land breeze came And a far sound of feathery quires; It seemed to blow from the dying flame, They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires. The horse towards the music raced, Neighing along the lifeless waste; Like sooty fingers, many a tree Rose ever out of the warm sea; And they were trembling ceaselessly, As though they all were beating time, Upon the centre of the sun, To that low laughing woodland rhyme. And, now our wandering hours were done, We cantered to the shore, and knew The reason of the trembling trees: Round every branch the song-birds flew, Or clung thereon like swarming bees; While round the shore a million stood Like drops of frozen rainbow light, And pondered in a soft vain mood, [183]Upon their shadows in the tide, And told the purple deeps their pride, And murmured snatches of delight; And on the shores were many boats With bending sterns and bending bows, And carven figures on their prows Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats, And swans with their exultant throats: And where the wood and waters meet We tied the horse in a leafy clump, And Niamh blew three merry notes Out of a little silver trump; And then an answering whisper flew Over the bare and woody land, A whisper of impetuous feet, And ever nearer, nearer grew; And from the woods rushed out a band Of men and maidens, hand in hand, And singing, singing altogether; Their brows were white as fragrant milk, Their cloaks made out of yellow silk, And trimmed with many a crimson feather: And when they saw the cloak I wore Was dim with mire of a mortal shore, They fingered it and gazed on me And laughed like murmurs of the sea; But Niamh with a swift distress Bid them away and hold their peace; [184]And when they heard her voice they ran And knelt them, every maid and man, And kissed, as they would never cease, Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress. She bade them bring us to the hall Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun, A Druid dream of the end of days When the stars are to wane and the world be done.You need but lift a pearl-pale hand, And bind up your long hair and sigh; And all men’s hearts must burn and beat; And candle-like foam on the dim sand, And stars climbing the dew-dropping sky, Live but to light your passing feet.They led us by long and shadowy ways Where drops of dew in myriads fall, And tangled creepers every hour Blossom in some new crimson flower, And once a sudden laughter sprang From all their lips, and once they sang Together, while the dark woods rang, And made in all their distant parts, With boom of bees in honey marts, A rumour of delighted hearts. And once a maiden by my side Gave me a harp, and bid me sing, And touch the laughing silver string; But when I sang of human joy A sorrow wrapped each merry face, And, Patric! by your beard, they wept, Until one came, a tearful boy; ‘A sadder creature never stept [185]Than this strange human bard,’ he cried; And caught the silver harp away, And, weeping over the white strings, hurled It down in a leaf-hid hollow place That kept dim waters from the sky; And each one said with a long, long sigh, ‘O saddest harp in all the world, Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!’And now still sad we came to where A beautiful young man dreamed within A house of wattles, clay, and skin; One hand upheld his beardless chin, And one a sceptre flashing out Wild flames of red and gold and blue, Like to a merry wandering rout Of dancers leaping in the air; And men and maidens knelt them there And showed their eyes with teardrops dim, And with low murmurs prayed to him, And kissed the sceptre with red lips, And touched it with their finger-tips.He held that flashing sceptre up. ‘Joy drowns the twilight in the dew, And fills with stars night’s purple cup, And wakes the sluggard seeds of corn, And stirs the young kid’s budding horn, [186]And makes the infant ferns unwrap, And for the peewit paints his cap, And rolls along the unwieldy sun, And makes the little planets run: And if joy were not on the earth, There were an end of change and birth, And earth and heaven and hell would die, And in some gloomy barrow lie Folded like a frozen fly; Then mock at Death and Time with glances And waving arms and wandering dances.‘Men’s hearts of old were drops of flame That from the saffron morning came, Or drops of silver joy that fell Out of the moon’s pale twisted shell; But now hearts cry that hearts are slaves, And toss and turn in narrow caves; But here there is nor law nor rule, Nor have hands held a weary tool; And here there is nor Change nor Death, But only kind and merry breath, For joy is God and God is joy.’ With one long glance on maid and boy And the pale blossom of the moon, He fell into a Druid swoon.And in a wild and sudden dance [187]We mocked at Time and Fate and Chance, And swept out of the wattled hall And came to where the dewdrops fall Among the foamdrops of the sea, And there we hushed the revelry; And, gathering on our brows a frown, Bent all our swaying bodies down, And to the waves that glimmer by That slooping green De Danaan sod Sang, ‘God is joy and joy is God, And things that have grown sad are wicked, And things that fear the dawn of the morrow, Or the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.’We danced to where in the winding thicket The damask roses, bloom on bloom, Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom, And bending over them softly said, Bending over them in the dance, With a swift and friendly glance From dewy eyes: ‘Upon the dead Fall the leaves of other roses, On the dead dim earth encloses: But never, never on our graves, Heaped beside the glimmering waves, Shall fall the leaves of damask roses. For neither Death nor Change comes near us, And all listless hours fear us, And we fear no dawning morrow, [188]Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.’The dance wound through the windless woods; The ever-summered solitudes; Until the tossing arms grew still Upon the woody central hill; And, gathered in a panting band, We flung on high each waving hand, And sang unto the starry broods: In our raised eyes there flashed a glow Of milky brightness to and fro As thus our song arose: ‘You stars, Across your wandering ruby cars Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God, He rules you with an iron rod, He holds you with an iron bond, Each one woven to the other, Each one woven to his brother Like bubbles in a frozen pond; But we in a lonely land abide Unchainable as the dim tide, With hearts that know nor law nor rule, And hands that hold no wearisome tool; Folded in love that fears no morrow, Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.’O Patric! for a hundred years I chased upon that woody shore The deer, the badger, and the boar. [189]O Patric! for a hundred years At evening on the glimmering sands, Beside the piled-up hunting spears, These now outworn and withered hands Wrestled among the island bands. O Patric! for a hundred years We went a-fishing in long boats With bending sterns and bending bows, And carven figures on their prows Of bitterns and fish-eating stoats. O Patric! for a hundred years The gentle Niamh was my wife; But now two things devour my life; The things that most of all I hate: Fasting and prayers.Tell on.Yes, yes, For these were ancient Oisin’s fate Loosed long ago from heaven’s gate, For his last days to lie in wait.Be you still, be you still, trembling heart; Remember the wisdom out of the old days: Him who trembles before the flame and the flood, And the winds that blow through the starry ways, Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood Cover over and hide, for he has no part With the proud, majestical multitude.When one day by the shore I stood, I drew out of the numberless [190]White flowers of the foam a staff of wood From some dead warrior’s broken lance: I turned it in my hands; the stains Of war were on it, and I wept, Remembering how the Fenians stept Along the blood-bedabbled plains, Equal to good or grievous chance: Thereon young Niamh softly came And caught my hands, but spake no word Save only many times my name, In murmurs, like a frighted bird. We passed by woods, and lawns of clover, And found the horse and bridled him, For we knew well the old was over. I heard one say ‘his eyes grow dim With all the ancient sorrow of men’; And wrapped in dreams rode out again With hoofs of the pale findrinny Over the glimmering purple sea: Under the golden evening light. The immortals moved among the fountains By rivers and the woods’ old night; Some danced like shadows on the mountains, Some wandered ever hand in hand, Or sat in dreams on the pale strand; Each forehead like an obscure star Bent down above each hooked knee: And sang, and with a dreamy gaze [191]Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze Was slumbering half in the sea ways; And, as they sang, the painted birds Kept time with their bright wings and feet; Like drops of honey came their words, But fainter than a young lamb’s bleat. ‘An old man stirs the fire to a blaze, In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother; He has over-lingered his welcome; the days, Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other; He hears the storm in the chimney above, And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold, While his heart still dreams of battle and love, And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.‘But we are apart in the grassy places, Where care cannot trouble the least of our days, Or the softness of youth be gone from our faces, Or love’s first tenderness die in our gaze. The hare grows old as she plays in the sun And gazes around her with eyes of brightness; Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done She limps along in an aged whiteness; A storm of birds in the Asian trees Like tulips in the air a-winging, And the gentle waves of the summer seas, That raise their heads and wander singing, [192]Must murmur at last “unjust, unjust”; And “my speed is a weariness,” falters the mouse; And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust, And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house. But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day When God shall come from the sea with a sigh And bid the stars drop down from the sky, And the moon like a pale rose wither away.’Now, man of croziers, shadows called our names And then away, away, like whirling flames; And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound, The youth and lady and the deer and hound; ‘Gaze no more on the phantoms,’ Niamh said, And kissed my eyes, and, swaying her bright head And her bright body, sang of faery and man Before God was or my old line began; Wars shadowy, vast, exultant; faeries of old Who wedded men with rings of Druid gold; And how those lovers never turn their eyes Upon the life that fades and flickers and dies, But love and kiss on dim shores far away Rolled round with music of the sighing spray: But sang no more, as when, like a brown bee That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea With me in her white arms a hundred years Before this day; for now the fall of tears [196]Troubled her song.I do not know if days Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays Shone many times among the glimmering flowers Wove in her flower-like hair, before dark towers Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed About them; and the horse of faery screamed And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears, Nor ceased until white Niamh stroked his ears And named him by sweet names.A foaming tide Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide, Burst from a great door marred by many a blow From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago When gods and giants warred. We rode between The seaweed-covered pillars, and the green And surging phosphorus alone gave light On our dark pathway, till a countless flight Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one The imaged meteors had flashed and run [197]And had disported in the stilly jet, And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set, Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother, The stream churned, churned, and churned—his lips apart, As though he told his never slumbering heart Of every foamdrop on its misty way: Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stairs And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were Hung from the morning star; when these mild words Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds: ‘My brothers spring out of their beds at morn, A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn They chase the noon-tide deer; And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare A larch-wood hunting spear.‘O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me; [198]Flutter along the froth lips of the sea, And shores the froth lips wet: And stay a little while, and bid them weep: Ah, touch their blue veined eyelids if they sleep, And shake their coverlet.‘When you have told how I weep endlessly, Flutter along the froth lips of the sea And home to me again, And in the shadow of my hair lie hid, And tell me how you came to one unbid, The saddest of all men.’A maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers, And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours, And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous As any ruddy moth, looked down on us; And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied To two old eagles, full of ancient pride, That with dim eyeballs stood on either side. Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings, For their dim minds were with the ancient things.‘I bring deliverance,’ pearl-pale Niamh said.‘Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead, [199]Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight My enemy and hope; demons for fright Jabber and scream about him in the night; For he is strong and crafty as the seas That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees. And I must needs endure and hate and weep, Until the gods and demons drop asleep, Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold.’The jester walked in the garden: The garden had fallen still; He bade his soul rise upward And stand on her window-sill.‘Is he so dreadful?’‘Be not over-bold, But flee while you may flee from him.’Then I: ‘This demon shall be pierced and drop and die, And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide.’‘Flee from him,’ pearl-pale Niamh weeping cried, ‘For all men flee the demons’; but moved not, Nor shook my firm and spacious soul one jot; There was no mightier soul of Heber’s line; Now it is old and mouse-like: for a sign I burst the chain: still earless, nerveless, blind, Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind, In some dim memory or ancient mood [200]Still earless, nerveless, blind, the eagles stood.And then we climbed the stair to a high door, A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor Beneath had paced content: we held our way And stood within: clothed in a misty ray I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float Under the roof, and with a straining throat Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star, For no man’s cry shall ever mount so far; Not even your God could have thrown down that hall; Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall, He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart, As though His hour were come.We sought the part That was most distant from the door; green slime Made the way slippery, and time on time Showed prints of sea-born scales, while down through it The captives’ journeys to and fro were writ Like a small river, and, where feet touched, came A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame. Under the deepest shadows of the hall That maiden found a ring hung on the wall, [201]And in the ring a torch, and with its flare Making a world about her in the air, Passed under a dim doorway, out of sight, And came again, holding a second light Burning between her fingers, and in mine Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine No centuries could dim: and a word ran Thereon in Ogham letters, ‘Mananan’: That sea-god’s name, who in a deep content Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent Out of the seven-fold seas, built the dark hall Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all The mightier masters of a mightier race; And at his cry there came no milk-pale face Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood, But only exultant faces.Niamh stood With bowed head, trembling when the white blade shone, But she whose hours of tenderness were gone Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide Under the shadows till the tumults died Of the loud crashing and earth-shaking fight, Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight; And thrust the torch between the slimy flags. A dome made out of endless carven jags, Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face, [202]Looked down on me; and in the self-same place I waited hour by hour, and the high dome Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze Was loaded with the memory of days Buried and mighty: when through the great door The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall And found a door deep sunken in the wall, The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain A little runnel made a bubbling strain, And on the runnel’s stony and bare edge A dusky demon dry as a withered sedge Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue: In a sad revelry he sang and swung Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro His hand along the runnel’s side, as though The flowers still grew there: far on the sea’s waste; Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased, While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light, Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright, Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned: A demon’s leisure: eyes, first white, now burned [203]Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose Barking. We trampled up and down with blows Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way; But when at withering of the sun he knew The Druid sword of Mananan, he grew To many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top; And I but held a corpse, with livid chop And dripping and sunken shape, to face and breast, When I tore down that tree; but when the west Surged up in plumy fire, I lunged and drave Through heart and spine, and cast him in the wave, Lest Niamh shudder.Full of hope and dread Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread, And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers, That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine; Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea-shine, [204]We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine, Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day; And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept. But when the sun once more in saffron stept, Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep, We sang the loves and angers without sleep, And all the exultant labours of the strong:But now the lying clerics murder song With barren words and flatteries of the weak. In what land do the powerless turn the beak Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath? For all your croziers, they have left the path And wander in the storms and clinging snows, Hopeless for ever: ancient Oisin knows, For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies On the anvil of the world.Be still: the skies Are choked with thunder, lightning, and fierce wind, For God has heard, and speaks His angry mind; Go cast your body on the stones and pray, For He has wrought midnight and dawn and day.[205]It rose in a straight blue garment, When owls began to call: It had grown wise-tongued by thinking Of a quiet and light footfall;Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder The Fenian horses; armour torn asunder; Laughter and cries: the armies clash and shock; All is done now; I see the ravens flock; Ah, cease, you mournful, laughing Fenian horn!We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn I found, dropping sea-foam on the wide stair, And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair, That demon dull and unsubduable; And once more to a day-long battle fell, And at the sundown threw him in the surge, To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge His new healed shape: and for a hundred years So warred, so feasted, with nor dreams, nor fears Nor languor nor fatigue: an endless feast, An endless war.The hundred years had ceased; I stood upon the stair: the surges bore A beech bough to me, and my heart grew sore, Remembering how I stood by white-haired Finn While the woodpecker made a merry din, [206]The hare leaped in the grass.Young Niamh came Holding that horse, and sadly called my name; I mounted, and we passed over the lone And drifting grayness, while this monotone, Surly and distant, mixed inseparably Into the clangour of the wind and sea:‘I hear my soul drop down into decay, And Mananan’s dark tower, stone by stone, Gather sea-slime and fall the seaward way, And the moon goad the waters night and day, That all be overthrown.‘But till the moon has taken all, I wage War on the mightiest men under the skies, And they have fallen or fled, age after age: Light is man’s love, and lighter is man’s rage; His purpose drifts and dies.’And then lost Niamh murmured, ‘Love, we go To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo! The Islands of Dancing and of Victories Are empty of all power.’‘And which of these Is the Island of Content?’‘None know,’ she said; And on my bosom laid her weeping head.Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke, High as the saddle girth, covering away from our glances the tide; And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-pale distance broke; The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces, and sighed.All things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old, The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart, The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould, Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.But the young queen would not listen; She rose in her pale night gown; She drew in the heavy casement And pushed the latches down.I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair, And never a song sang Niamh, and over my finger-tips Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-cold air, And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of lips.Were we days long or hours long in riding, when rolled in a grisly peace, [210]An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak? And we stood on a sea’s edge we saw not; for whiter than new-washed fleece Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke.And we rode on the plains of the sea’s edge; the sea’s edge barren and gray, Gray sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees, Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their wrinkling bark; Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that one sound; For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in the dark: Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the ground.And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night, For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world and the sun, [211]Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light, And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was one.Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems of the hazel and oak, A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the long grass lay, Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumbering folk, Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way.And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and shield and blade; And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of three years old Could sleep on a bed of rushes, and all inwrought and inlaid, And more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold.And each of the huge white creatures was huger than four-score men; The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were the claws of birds, And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen, [212]The breathing came from those bodies, long-warless, grown whiter than curds.The wood was so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from His dew-cumbered skies; So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests in their locks, Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes.And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came, Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide; And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in the soft star-flame, Lay loose in a place of shadow: we drew the reins by his side.He bade his heart go to her, When the owls called out no more; In a red and quivering garment [23]It sang to her through the door.Golden the nails of his bird-claws, flung loosely along the dim ground; In one was a branch soft-shining, with bells more many than sighs, In midst of an old man’s bosom; owls ruffling and pacing around, Sidled their bodies against him, filling the shade with their eyes.[213]And my gaze was thronged with the sleepers; for nowhere in any clann Of the high people of Soraca nor in glamour by demons flung, Are faces alive with such beauty made known to the salt eye of man, Yet weary with passions that faded when the sevenfold seas were young.And I gazed on the bell-branch, sleep’s forebear, far sung by the Sennachies. I saw how those slumberers, grown weary, there camping in grasses deep, Of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of the wandering seas, Laid hands on the bell-branch and swayed it, and fed of unhuman sleep.Snatching the horn of Niamh, I blew a lingering note; Came sound from those monstrous sleepers, a sound like the stirring of flies. He, shaking the fold of his lips, and heaving the pillar of his throat, Watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of his eyes.I cried, ‘Come out of the shadow, king of the nails of gold! [214]And tell of your goodly household and the goodly works of your hands, That we may muse in the starlight and talk of the battles of old; Your questioner, Oisin, is worthy, he comes from the Fenian lands.’Half open his eyes were, and held me, dull with the smoke of their dreams; His lips moved slowly in answer, no answer out of them came; Then he swayed in his fingers the bell-branch, slow dropping a sound in faint streams Softer than snow-flakes in April and piercing the marrow like flame.Wrapt in the wave of that music, with weariness more than of earth, The moil of my centuries filled me; and gone like a sea-covered stone Were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the memories of the whole of my mirth, And a softness came from the starlight and filled me full to the bone.In the roots of the grasses, the sorrels, I laid my body as low; [215]And the pearl-pale Niamh lay by me, her brow on the midst of my breast; And the horse was gone in the distance, and years after years ’gan flow; Square leaves of the ivy moved over us, binding us down to our rest.And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot; How the fetlocks drip blood in the battle, when the fallen on fallen lie rolled; How the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of the heron’s plot, And the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for Midhir of old.And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot; That the spearshaft is made out of ashwood, the shield out of osier and hide; How the hammers spring on the anvil, on the spear-head’s burning spot; How the slow, blue-eyed oxen of Finn low sadly at evening tide.It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming, Of a flutter of flower-like hair; But she took up her fan from the table And waved it off on the air.But in dreams, mild man of the croziers, driving the dust with their throngs, Moved round me, of seamen or landsmen, all who are winter tales; [216]Came by me the Kings of the Red Branch, with roaring of laughter and songs, Or moved as they moved once, love-making or piercing the tempest with sails.Came Blanid, MacNessa, tall Fergus who feastward of old time slunk; Cook Barach, the traitor; and warward, the spittle on his beard never dry, Dark Balor, as old as a forest, car-borne, his mighty head sunk Helpless, men lifting the lids of his weary and death-making eye.And by me, in soft red raiment, the Fenians moved in loud streams, And Grania, walking and smiling, sewed with her needle of bone. So lived I and lived not, so wrought I and wrought not, with creatures of dreams, In a long iron sleep, as a fish in the water goes dumb as a stone.At times our slumber was lightened. When the sun was on silver or gold; When brushed with the wings of the owls, in the dimness they love going by; When a glow-worm was green on a grass leaf lured from his lair in the mould; [217]Half wakening, we lifted our eyelids, and gazed on the grass with a sigh.So watched I when, man of the croziers, at the heel of a century fell, Weak, in the midst of the meadow, from his miles in the midst of the air, A starling like them that forgathered ’neath a moon waking white as a shell, When the Fenians made foray at morning with Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair.I awoke: the strange horse without summons out of the distance ran, Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his bosom deep That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man, And that I would leave the immortals, their dimness, their dews dropping sleep.O, had you seen beautiful Niamh grow white as the waters are white, Lord of the croziers, you even had lifted your hands and wept: But, the bird in my fingers, I mounted, remembering alone that delight Of twilight and slumber were gone, and that hoofs impatiently stept.[218]I cried, ‘O Niamh! O white one! if only a twelve-houred day, I must gaze on the beard of Finn, and move where the old men and young In the Fenians’ dwellings of wattle lean on the chessboards and play, Ah, sweet to me now were even bald Conan’s slanderous tongue!‘Like me were some galley forsaken far off in Meridian isle, Remembering its long-oared companions, sails turning to thread-bare rags; No more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile, But to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes and flags.’Their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with mysterious thought, Watched her those seamless faces from the valley’s glimmering girth; As she murmured, ‘O wandering Oisin, the strength of the bell-branch is naught, For there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sadness of earth.‘I have cap and bells,’ he pondered, ‘I will send them to her and die’; And when the morning whitened He left them where she went by.‘Then go through the lands in the saddle and see what the mortals do, [219]And softly come to your Niamh over the tops of the tide; But weep for your Niamh, O Oisin, weep; for if only your shoe Brush lightly as haymouse earth pebbles, you will come no more to my side.‘O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?’ I saw from a distant saddle; from the earth she made her moan; ‘I would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn, for breast unto breast We shall mingle no more, nor our gazes empty their sweetness lone‘In the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come. Were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon who sleeps on her nest, Nor lost in the star-fires and odours the sound of the sea’s vague drum, O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?’The wailing grew distant; I rode by the woods of the wrinkling bark, Where ever is murmurous dropping, old silence and that one sound; [220]For no live creatures live there, no weasels move in the dark; In a reverie forgetful of all things, over the bubbling ground.And I rode by the plains of the sea’s edge, where all is barren and gray, Gray sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees, Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away, Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.And the winds made the sands on the sea’s edge turning and turning go, As my mind made the names of the Fenians. Far from the hazel and oak I rode away on the surges, where, high as the saddle bow, Fled foam underneath me, and round me, a wandering and milky smoke.Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast, Snatching the bird in secret; nor knew I, embosomed apart, When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast, [221]For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my heart.Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell down; Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away, From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-weeds brown.If I were as I once was, the strong hoofs crushing the sand and the shells, Coming out of the sea as the dawn comes, a chaunt of love on my lips, Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the bells, I would leave no saint’s head on his body from Rachlin to Bera of ships.Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and woodwork made, Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath, And a small and feeble race stooping with mattock and spade.She laid them upon her bosom, Under a cloud of her hair, And her red lips sang them a love-song: Till stars grew out of the air.[222]Or weeding or ploughing with faces a-shining with much-toil wet; While in this place and that place, with bodies unglorious, their chieftains stood, Awaiting in patience the straw-death, croziered one, caught in their net: Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring of wind in a wood.And because I went by them so huge and so speedy with eyes so bright, Came after the hard gaze of youth, or an old man lifted his head: And I rode and I rode, and I cried out, ‘The Fenians hunt wolves in the night, So sleep they by daytime.’ A voice cried, ‘The Fenians a long time are dead.’A whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway, the flesh of his face as dried grass, And in folds round his eyes and his mouth, he sad as a child without milk; And the dreams of the islands were gone, and I knew how men sorrow and pass, And their hound, and their horse, and their love, and their eyes that glimmer like silk.And wrapping my face in my hair, I murmured, ‘In old age they ceased’; [223]And my tears were larger than berries, and I murmured, ‘Where white clouds lie spread On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old they feast On the floors of the gods.’ He cried, ‘No, the gods a long time are dead.’And lonely and longing for Niamh, I shivered and turned me about, The heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into her heart; I turned and rode to the westward, and followed the sea’s old shout Till I saw where Maeve lies sleeping till starlight and midnight part.And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a sack full of sand, They bore it with staggering and sweating, but fell with their burden at length: Leaning down from the gem-studded saddle, I flung it five yards with my hand, With a sob for men waxing so weakly, a sob for the Fenians’ old strength.The rest you have heard of, O croziered one; how, when divided the girth, I fell on the path, and the horse went away like a summer fly; [224]And my years three hundred fell on me, and I rose, and walked on the earth, A creeping old man, full of sleep, with the spittle on his beard never dry.How the men of the sand-sack showed me a church with its belfry in air; Sorry place, where for swing of the war-axe in my dim eyes the crozier gleams; What place have Caolte and Conan, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair? Speak, you too are old with your memories, an old man surrounded with dreams.Where the flesh of the footsole clingeth on the burning stones is their place; Where the demons whip them with wires on the burning stones of wide hell, Watching the blessed ones move far off, and the smile on God’s face, Between them a gateway of brass, and the howl of the angels who fell.Put the staff in my hands; for I go to the Fenians, O cleric, to chaunt [225]The war-songs that roused them of old; they will rise, making clouds with their breath Innumerable, singing, exultant; the clay underneath them shall pant, And demons be broken in pieces, and trampled beneath them in death.She opened her door and her window, And the heart and the soul came through, To her right hand came the red one, To her left hand came the blue.And demons afraid in their darkness; deep horror of eyes and of wings, Afraid their ears on the earth laid, shall listen and rise up and weep; Hearing the shaking of shields and the quiver of stretched bowstrings, Hearing hell loud with a murmur, as shouting and mocking we sweep.We will tear out the flaming stones, and batter the gateway of brass And enter, and none sayeth ‘No’ when there enters the strongly armed guest; Make clean as a broom cleans, and march on as oxen move over young grass; Then feast, making converse of Eire, of wars, and of old wounds, and rest.On the flaming stones, without refuge, the limbs of the Fenians are tost; [226]None war on the masters of Hell, who could break up the world in their rage; But kneel and wear out the flags and pray for your soul that is lost Through the demon love of its youth and its godless and passionate age.Ah, me! to be shaken with coughing and broken with old age and pain, Without laughter, a show unto children, alone with remembrance and fear, All emptied of purple hours as a beggar’s cloak in the rain, As a grass seed crushed by a pebble, as a wolf sucked under a weir.It were sad to gaze on the blessed and no man I loved of old there; I throw down the chain of small stones! when life in my body has ceased, I will go to Caolte, and Conan, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair, And dwell in the house of the Fenians, be they in flames or at feast.‘I am but an empty shade, Far from life and passion laid; Yet does sweet remembrance thrill All my shadowy being still.’The friends that have it I do wrong When ever I remake a song, Should know what issue is at stake: It is myself that I remake.I welcome you that have the mastery Of the two kinds of Music: the one kind Being like a woman, the other like a man. Both you that understand stringed instruments, And how to mingle words and notes together So artfully, that all the Art’s but Speech Delighted with its own music; and you that carry The long twisted horn, and understand The heady notes that, being without words, [8]Can hurry beyond Time and Fate and Change. For the high angels that drive the horse of Time— The golden one by day, by night the silver— Are not more welcome to one that loves the world For some fair woman’s sake. I have called you hither To save the life of your great master, Seanchan, For all day long it has flamed up or flickered To the fast cooling hearth. When did he sicken? Is it a fever that is wasting him? No fever or sickness. He has chosen death: Refusing to eat or drink, that he may bring Disgrace upon me; for there is a custom, An old and foolish custom, that if a man Be wronged, or think that he is wronged, and starve Upon another’s threshold till he die, The common people, for all time to come, Will raise a heavy cry against that threshold, Even though it be the King’s.[9] My head whirls round; I do not know what I am to think or say. I owe you all obedience, and yet How can I give it, when the man I have loved More than all others, thinks that he is wronged So bitterly, that he will starve and die Rather than bear it? Is there any man Will throw his life away for a light issue? It is but fitting that you take his side Until you understand how light an issue Has put us by the ears. Three days ago I yielded to the outcry of my courtiers— Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law— Who long had thought it against their dignity For a mere man of words to sit amongst them At my own table. When the meal was spread, I ordered Seanchan to a lower table; And when he pleaded for the poets’ right, Established at the establishment of the world, I said that I was King, and that all rights Had their original fountain in some king, And that it was the men who ruled the world, [10]And not the men who sang to it, who should sit Where there was the most honour. My courtiers— Bishops, Soldiers, and Makers of the Law— Shouted approval; and amid that noise Seanchan went out, and from that hour to this, Although there is good food and drink beside him, Has eaten nothing. I can breathe again. You have taken a great burden from my mind, For that old custom’s not worth dying for. Persuade him to eat or drink. Till yesterday I thought that hunger and weakness had been enough; But finding them too trifling and too light To hold his mouth from biting at the grave, I called you hither, and all my hope’s in you, And certain of his neighbours and good friends That I have sent for. While he is lying there Perishing, my good name in the world Is perishing also. I cannot give way, [11]Because I am King. Because if I gave way, My Nobles would call me a weakling, and it may be The very throne be shaken. I will persuade him. Your words had been enough persuasion, King; But being lost in sleep or reverie, He cannot hear them. Make him eat or drink. Nor is it all because of my good name I’d have him do it, for he is a man That might well hit the fancy of a king, Banished out of his country, or a woman’s, Or any other’s that can judge a man For what he is. But I that sit a throne, And take my measure from the needs of the State, Call his wild thought that overruns the measure, Making words more than deeds, and his proud will That would unsettle all, most mischievous, And he himself a most mischievous man. [12]Promise a house with grass and tillage land, An annual payment, jewels and silken ware, Or anything but that old right of the poets. The King did wrong to abrogate our right; But Seanchan, who talks of dying for it, Talks foolishly. Look at us, Seanchan; Waken out of your dream and look at us, Who have ridden under the moon and all the day, Until the moon has all but come again, That we might be beside you. I was but now In Almhuin, in a great high-raftered house, With Finn and Osgar. Odours of roast flesh Rose round me, and I saw the roasting-spits; And then the dream was broken, and I saw Grania dividing salmon by a stream. Hunger has made you dream of roasting flesh; [13]And though I all but weep to think of it, The hunger of the crane, that starves himself At the full moon because he is afraid Of his own shadow and the glittering water, Seems to me little more fantastical Than this of yours. Why, that’s the very truth. It is as though the moon changed everything— Myself and all that I can hear and see; For when the heavy body has grown weak, There’s nothing that can tether the wild mind That, being moonstruck and fantastical, Goes where it fancies. I had even thought I knew your voice and face, but now the words Are so unlikely that I needs must ask Who is it that bids me put my hunger by. I am your oldest pupil, Seanchan; The one that has been with you many years— So many, that you said at Candlemas That I had almost done with school, and knew All but all that poets understand. [14]My oldest pupil? No, that cannot be, For it is some one of the courtly crowds That have been round about me from sunrise, And I am tricked by dreams; but I’ll refute them. At Candlemas I bid that pupil tell me Why poetry is honoured, wishing to know If he had any weighty argument For distant countries and strange, churlish kings. What did he answer? I said the poets hung Images of the life that was in Eden About the child-bed of the world, that it, Looking upon those images, might bear Triumphant children. But why must I stand here, Repeating an old lesson, while you starve? Tell on, for I begin to know the voice. What evil thing will come upon the world If the Arts perish? If the Arts should perish, [15]The world that lacked them would be like a woman, That looking on the cloven lips of a hare, Brings forth a hare-lipped child. But that’s not all: For when I asked you how a man should guard Those images, you had an answer also, If you’re the man that you have claimed to be, Comparing them to venerable things God gave to men before he gave them wheat. I answered—and the word was half your own— That he should guard them as the Men of Dea Guard their four treasures, as the Grail King guards His holy cup, or the pale, righteous horse The jewel that is underneath his horn, Pouring out life for it as one pours out Sweet heady wine.... But now I understand; You would refute me out of my own mouth; And yet a place at table, near the King, Is nothing of great moment, Seanchan. How does so light a thing touch poetry?At Candlemas you called this poetry One of the fragile, mighty things of God, That die at an insult. Give me some true answer, For on that day we spoke about the Court, And said that all that was insulted there The world insulted, for the Courtly life, Being the first comely child of the world, Is the world’s model. How shall I answer him? Can you not give me some true argument? I will not tempt him with a lying one. O, tell him that the lovers of his music Have need of him. But I am labouring For some that shall be born in the nick o’ time, And find sweet nurture, that they may have voices, [17]Even in anger, like the strings of harps; And how could they be born to majesty If I had never made the golden cradle? Why did you take me from my father’s fields? If you would leave me now, what shall I love? Where shall I go? What shall I set my hand to? And why have you put music in my ears, If you would send me to the clattering houses? I will throw down the trumpet and the harp, For how could I sing verses or make music With none to praise me, and a broken heart? What was it that the poets promised you, If it was not their sorrow? Do not speak. Have I not opened school on these bare steps, And are not you the youngest of my scholars? And I would have all know that when all falls In ruin, poetry calls out in joy, Being the scattering hand, the bursting pod, The victim’s joy among the holy flame, God’s laughter at the shattering of the world. And now that joy laughs out, and weeps and burns On these bare steps.[18] O master, do not die! Trouble him with no useless argument. Be silent! There is nothing we can do Except find out the King and kneel to him, And beg our ancient right. For here are some To say whatever we could say and more, And fare as badly. Come, boy, that is no use. If it seem well that we beseech the King, Lay down your harps and trumpets on the stones In silence, and come with me silently. Come with slow footfalls, and bow all your heads, For a bowed head becomes a mourner best. ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land,’ Those are the words I have to keep in mind— ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land.’ I have the words. They are all upon the Ogham. ‘Chief Poet,’ ‘Ireland,’ ‘Townsman,’ ‘Grazing land.’ But what’s their order? The King were rightly served If Seanchan drove his good luck away. What’s there about a king, that’s in the world From birth to burial like another man, That he should change old customs, that were in it As long as ever the world has been a world?[20] If I were king I would not meddle with him, For there is something queer about a poet. I knew of one that would be making rhyme Under a thorn at crossing of three roads. He was as ragged as ourselves, and yet He was no sooner dead than every thorn tree From Inchy to Kiltartan withered away. The King is but a fool! I am getting ready. A poet has power from beyond the world, That he may set our thoughts upon old times, And lucky queens and little holy fish That rise up every seventh year—— Hush! hush! To cure the crippled.[21] I am half ready now. There’s not a mischief I’d begrudge the King If it were any other—— Hush! I am ready. That died to get it. I have brought out the food, And if my master will not eat of it, I’ll home and get provision for his wake, For that’s no great way off. Well, have your say, But don’t be long about it. Chief Poet of Ireland, I am the Mayor of your own town Kinvara, And I am come to tell you that the news Of this great trouble with the King of Gort [22]Has plunged us in deep sorrow—part for you, Our honoured townsman, part for our good town. But what comes now? Something about the King. Get on! get on! The food is all set out. Don’t hurry me. Give us a taste of it. He’ll not begrudge it. Let them that have their limbs Starve if they will. We have to keep in mind The stomach God has left us. Hush! I have it! The King was said to be most friendly to us, [23]And we have reason, as you’ll recollect, For thinking that he was about to give Those grazing lands inland we so much need, Being pinched between the water and the stones. Our mowers mow with knives between the stones; The sea washes the meadows. You know well We have asked nothing but what’s reasonable. Reason in plenty. Yellowy white hair, A hollow face, and not too many teeth. How comes it he has been so long in the world And not found Reason out? What good is there In telling him what he has heard all day! I will set food before him. [24]Don’t hurry me! It’s small respect you’re showing to the town! Get farther off! [To SEANCHAN.] We would not have you think, Weighty as these considerations are, That they have been as weighty in our minds As our desire that one we take much pride in, A man that’s been an honour to our town, Should live and prosper; therefore we beseech you To give way in a matter of no moment, A matter of mere sentiment—a trifle— That we may always keep our pride in you. Master, master, eat this! It’s not king’s food, That’s cooked for everybody and nobody. Here’s barley-bread out of your father’s oven, And dulse from Duras. Here is the dulse, your honour; It’s wholesome, and has the good taste of the sea. He has taken it, and there’ll be nothing left! Nothing at all; he wanted his own sort. What’s honey to a cat, corn to a dog, Or a green apple to a ghost in a churchyard? Eat it yourself, for you have come a journey, And it may be eat nothing on the way. How could I eat it, and your honour starving! It is your father sends it, and he cried Because the stiffness that is in his bones Prevented him from coming, and bid me tell you That he is old, that he has need of you, And that the people will be pointing at him, And he not able to lift up his head, If you should turn the King’s favour away; And he adds to it, that he cared you well, And you in your young age, and that it’s right That you should care him now.[26] And is that all? What did my mother say? She gave no message; For when they told her you had it in mind to starve, Or get again the ancient right of the poets, She said: ‘No message can do any good. He will not send the answer that you want. We cannot change him.’ And she went indoors, Lay down upon the bed, and turned her face Out of the light. And thereupon your father Said: ‘Tell him that his mother sends no message, Albeit broken down and miserable.’      [A pause. Here’s a pigeon’s egg from Duras, and these others Were laid by your own hens. She has sent no message. [27]Our mothers know us; they know us to the bone. They knew us before birth, and that is why They know us even better than the sweethearts Upon whose breasts we have lain. Go quickly! Go And tell them that my mother was in the right. There is no answer. Go and tell them that. Go tell them that she knew me. What is he saying? I never understood a poet’s talk More than the baa of a sheep! You have not heard, It may be, having been so much away, How many of the cattle died last winter From lacking grass, and that there was much sickness Because the poor have nothing but salt fish To live on through the winter? Get away, And leave the place to me! It’s my turn now, For your sack’s empty![28] Is it ‘get away’! Is that the way I’m to be spoken to! Am I not Mayor? Amn’t I authority? Amn’t I in the King’s place? Answer me that! Then show the people what a king is like: Pull down old merings and root custom up, Whitewash the dunghills, fatten hogs and geese, Hang your gold chain about an ass’s neck, And burn the blessed thorn trees out of the fields, And drive what’s comely away! Holy Saint Coleman! Fine talk! fine talk! What else does the King do? He fattens hogs and drives the poet away! He starves the song-maker![29]Cuchulain has killed kings, Kings and sons of kings, Dragons out of the water, And witches out of the air, Banachas and Bonachas and people of the woods.They set up a noise like crickets, A chattering wise and sweet, And her hair was a folded flower And the quiet of love in her feet.Witches that steal the milk, Fomor that steal the children, Hags that have heads like hares, Hares that have claws like witches, All riding a-cockhorseHe has killed kings, Kings and the sons of kings, Dragons out of the water, And witches out of the air, Banachas and Bonachas and people of the woods.Because I have killed men without your bidding And have rewarded others at my own pleasure, Because of half a score of trifling things You’d lay this oath upon me, and now—and now You add another pebble to the heap. And I must be your man, well-nigh your bondsman, Because a youngster out of Aoife’s country Has found the shore ill-guarded. He came to land While you were somewhere out of sight and hearing, Hunting or dancing with your wild companions. [86]He can be driven out. I’ll not be bound. I’ll dance or hunt, or quarrel or make love, Wherever and whenever I’ve a mind to. If time had not put water in your blood, You never would have thought it. I would leave A strong and settled country to my children. And I must be obedient in all things; Give up my will to yours; go where you please; Come when you call; sit at the council-board Among the unshapely bodies of old men. I whose mere name has kept this country safe, I that in early days have driven out Maeve of Cruachan and the northern pirates, The hundred kings of Sorcha, and the kings Out of the Garden in the East of the World. Must I, that held you on the throne when all Had pulled you from it, swear obedience As if I were some cattle-raising king? Are my shins speckled with the heat of the fire, Or have my hands no skill but to make figures Upon the ashes with a stick? Am I So slack and idle that I need a whip Before I serve you?[87] No, no whip, Cuchulain, But every day my children come and say: ‘This man is growing harder to endure. How can we be at safety with this man That nobody can buy or bid or bind? We shall be at his mercy when you are gone; He burns the earth as if he were a fire, And time can never touch him.’ And so the tale Grows finer yet; and I am to obey Whatever child you set upon the throne, As if it were yourself! Most certainly. I am High King, my son shall be High King; And you for all the wildness of your blood, And though your father came out of the sun, Are but a little king and weigh but light In anything that touches government, If put into the balance with my children. [88]It’s well that we should speak our minds out plainly, For when we die we shall be spoken of In many countries. We in our young days Have seen the heavens like a burning cloud Brooding upon the world, and being more Than men can be now that cloud’s lifted up, We should be the more truthful. Conchubar, I do not like your children—they have no pith, No marrow in their bones, and will lie soft Where you and I lie hard. You rail at them Because you have no children of your own. I think myself most lucky that I leave No pallid ghost or mockery of a man To drift and mutter in the corridors, Where I have laughed and sung. That is not true, For all your boasting of the truth between us; For, there is no man having house and lands, That have been in the one family And called by the one name for centuries, But is made miserable if he know They are to pass into a stranger’s keeping, As yours will pass.[89] The most of men feel that, But you and I leave names upon the harp. You play with arguments as lawyers do, And put no heart in them. I know your thoughts, For we have slept under the one cloak and drunk From the one wine cup. I know you to the bone. I have heard you cry, aye in your very sleep, ‘I have no son,’ and with such bitterness That I have gone upon my knees and prayed That it might be amended. For you thought That I should be as biddable as others Had I their reason for it; but that’s not true, For I would need a weightier argument Than one that marred me in the copying, As I have that clean hawk out of the air That, as men say, begot this body of mine Upon a mortal woman. Now as ever You mock at every reasonable hope, And would have nothing, or impossible things. What eye has ever looked upon the child Would satisfy a mind like that?[90] I would leave My house and name to none that would not face Even myself in battle. Being swift of foot, And making light of every common chance, You should have overtaken on the hills Some daughter of the air, or on the shore A daughter of the Country-under-Wave. I am not blasphemous. Yet you despise Our queens, and would not call a child your own, If one of them had borne him. I have not said it. Ah! I remember I have heard you boast, [91]When the ale was in your blood, that there was one In Scotland, where you had learnt the trade of war, That had a stone-pale cheek and red-brown hair. And that although you had loved other women, You’d sooner that fierce woman of the camp Bore you a son than any queen among them. You call her a ‘fierce woman of the camp,’ For having lived among the spinning-wheels, You’d have no woman near that would not say, ‘Ah! how wise!’ ‘What will you have for supper?’ ‘What shall I wear that I may please you, sir?’ And keep that humming through the day and night Forever. A fierce woman of the camp! But I am getting angry about nothing. You have never seen her. Ah! Conchubar, had you seen her With that high, laughing, turbulent head of hers Thrown backward, and the bow-string at her ear, Or sitting at the fire with those grave eyes Full of good counsel as it were with wine, Or when love ran through all the lineaments [92]Of her wild body—although she had no child, None other had all beauty, queen, or lover, Or was so fitted to give birth to kings. There’s nothing I can say but drifts you farther From the one weighty matter. That very woman— For I know well that you are praising Aoife— Now hates you and will leave no subtilty Unknotted that might run into a noose About your throat, no army in idleness That might bring ruin on this land you serve. No wonder in that, no wonder at all in that. I never have known love but as a kiss In the mid-battle, and a difficult truce Of oil and water, candles and dark night, Hillside and hollow, the hot-footed sun, And the cold, sliding, slippery-footed moon— A brief forgiveness between opposites That have been hatreds for three times the age Of this long-’stablished ground. Listen to me. [93]Aoife makes war on us, and every day Our enemies grow greater and beat the walls More bitterly, and you within the walls Are every day more turbulent; and yet, When I would speak about these things, your fancy Runs as it were a swallow on the wind.Look at the door and what men gather there— Old counsellors that steer the land with me, And younger kings, the dancers and harp-players That follow in your tumults, and all these Are held there by the one anxiety. Will you be bound into obedience And so make this land safe for them and theirs? You are but half a king and I but half; I need your might of hand and burning heart, And you my wisdom. Nestlings of a high nest, [94]Hawks that have followed me into the air And looked upon the sun, we’ll out of this And sail upon the wind once more. This king Would have me take an oath to do his will, And having listened to his tune from morning, I will no more of it. Run to the stable And set the horses to the chariot-pole, And send a messenger to the harp-players. We’ll find a level place among the woods, And dance awhile. Cuchulain, take the oath. There is none here that would not have you take it. You’d have me take it? Are you of one mind? All, all, all, all! Do what the High King bids you. There is not one but dreads this turbulence Now that they’re settled men.[95] Are you so changed, Or have I grown more dangerous of late? But that’s not it. I understand it all. It’s you that have changed. You’ve wives and children now, And for that reason cannot follow one That lives like a bird’s flight from tree to tree.— It’s time the years put water in my blood And drowned the wildness of it, for all’s changed, But that unchanged.—I’ll take what oath you will: The moon, the sun, the water, light, or air, I do not care how binding. On this fire That has been lighted from your hearth and mine; The older men shall be my witnesses, The younger, yours. The holders of the fire Shall purify the thresholds of the house With waving fire, and shut the outer door, According to the custom; and sing rhyme That has come down from the old law-makers To blow the witches out. Considering That the wild will of man could be oath-bound, [96]But that a woman’s could not, they bid us sing Against the will of woman at its wildest In the shape-changers that run upon the wind.May this fire have driven out The shape-changers that can put Ruin on a great king’s house Until all be ruinous. Names whereby a man has known The threshold and the hearthstone, Gather on the wind and drive The women, none can kiss and thrive, For they are but whirling wind, Out of memory and mind. They would make a prince decay With light images of clay, Planted in the running wave; Or, for many shapes they have, They would change them into hounds, Until he had died of his wounds, Though the change were but a whim; Or they’d hurl a spell at him, [97]That he follow with desire Bodies that can never tire, Or grow kind, for they anoint All their bodies, joint by joint, With a miracle-working juice That is made out of the grease Of the ungoverned unicorn. But the man is thrice forlorn, Emptied, ruined, wracked, and lost, That they follow, for at most They will give him kiss for kiss; While they murmur, ‘After this Hatred may be sweet to the taste.’ Those wild hands that have embraced All his body can but shove At the burning wheel of love, Till the side of hate comes up. Therefore in this ancient cup May the sword-blades drink their fill Of the homebrew there, until They will have for masters none But the threshold and hearthstone. I’ll take and keep this oath, and from this day [98]I shall be what you please, my chicks, my nestlings. Yet I had thought you were of those that praised Whatever life could make the pulse run quickly, Even though it were brief, and that you held That a free gift was better than a forced.— But that’s all over.—I will keep it, too. I never gave a gift and took it again. If the wild horse should break the chariot-pole, It would be punished. Should that be in the oath?I swear to be obedient in all things To Conchubar, and to uphold his children. We are one being, as these flames are one: I give my wisdom, and I take your strength. Now thrust the swords into the flame, and pray That they may serve the threshold and the hearthstone With faithful service.O pure, glittering ones That should be more than wife or friend or mistress, Give us the enduring will, the unquenchable hope, The friendliness of the sword!—Some king that has been loitering on the way. Open the door, for I would have all know That the oath’s finished and Cuchulain bound, And that the swords are drinking up the flame.I am of Aoife’s army. Put up your swords. He is but one. Aoife is far away.[100] I have come alone into the midst of you To weigh this sword against Cuchulain’s sword. And are you noble? for if of common seed, You cannot weigh your sword against his sword But in mixed battle. I am under bonds To tell my name to no man; but it’s noble. But I would know your name and not your bonds. You cannot speak in the Assembly House, If you are not noble. Answer the High King! I will give no other proof than the hawk gives— That it’s no sparrow! Yet look upon me, kings. I, too, am of that ancient seed, and carry The signs about this body and in these bones.[101] To have shown the hawk’s grey feather is enough, And you speak highly, too. Give me that helmet. I’d thought they had grown weary sending champions. That sword and belt will do. This fighting’s welcome. The High King there has promised me his wisdom; But the hawk’s sleepy till its well-beloved Cries out amid the acorns, or it has seen Its enemy like a speck upon the sun. What’s wisdom to the hawk, when that clear eye Is burning nearer up in the high air? Hither into the light. The very tint Of her that I was speaking of but now. Not a pin’s difference. You are from the North Where there are many that have that tint of hair— [102]Red-brown, the light red-brown. Come nearer, boy, For I would have another look at you. There’s more likeness—a pale, a stone-pale cheek. What brought you, boy? Have you no fear of death? Whether I live or die is in the gods’ hands. That is all words, all words; a young man’s talk. I am their plough, their harrow, their very strength; For he that’s in the sun begot this body Upon a mortal woman, and I have heard tell It seemed as if he had outrun the moon; That he must follow always through waste heaven, He loved so happily. He’ll be but slow To break a tree that was so sweetly planted. Let’s see that arm. I’ll see it if I choose. That arm had a good father and a good mother, But it is not like this. You are mocking me; You think I am not worthy to be fought. But I’ll not wrangle but with this talkative knife.[103] Put up your sword; I am not mocking you. I’d have you for my friend, but if it’s not Because you have a hot heart and a cold eye, I cannot tell the reason. [To CONCHUBAR.] He has got her fierceness, And nobody is as fierce as those pale women. But I will keep him with me, Conchubar, That he may set my memory upon her When the day’s fading.—You will stop with us, And we will hunt the deer and the wild bulls; And, when we have grown weary, light our fires Between the wood and water, or on some mountain Where the shape-changers of the morning come. The High King there would make a mock of me Because I did not take a wife among them. Why do you hang your head? It’s a good life: The head grows prouder in the light of the dawn, And friendship thickens in the murmuring dark Where the spare hazels meet the wool-white foam. But I can see there’s no more need for words And that you’ll be my friend from this day out.[104] He has come hither not in his own name But in Queen Aoife’s, and has challenged us In challenging the foremost man of us all. Well, well, what matter? You think it does not matter; And that a fancy lighter than the air, A whim of the moment has more matter in it. For having none that shall reign after you, You cannot think as I do, who would leave A throne too high for insult. Let your children Re-mortar their inheritance, as we have, And put more muscle on.—I’ll give you gifts, But I’d have something too—that arm-ring, boy. We’ll have this quarrel out when you are older. There is no man I’d sooner have my friend [105]Than you, whose name has gone about the world As if it had been the wind; but Aoife’d say I had turned coward. I will give you gifts That Aoife’ll know, and all her people know, To have come from me.       [Showing cloak. My father gave me this. He came to try me, rising up at dawn Out of the cold dark of the rich sea. He challenged me to battle, but before My sword had touched his sword, told me his name, Gave me this cloak, and vanished. It was woven By women of the Country-under-Wave Out of the fleeces of the sea. O! tell her I was afraid, or tell her what you will. No; tell her that I heard a raven croak On the north side of the house, and was afraid. Some witch of the air has troubled Cuchulain’s mind. No witchcraft. His head is like a woman’s head I had a fancy for.[106] A witch of the air Can make a leaf confound us with memories. They run upon the wind and hurl the spells That make us nothing, out of the invisible wind. They have gone to school to learn the trick of it. No, no—there’s nothing out of common here; The winds are innocent.—That arm-ring, boy. If I’ve your leave I’ll take this challenge up. No, give it me, High King, for this wild Aoife Has carried off my slaves. No, give it me, For she has harried me in house and herd. I claim this fight. And I! And I! And I![107] Back! back! Put up your swords! Put up your swords! There’s none alive that shall accept a challenge I have refused. Laegaire, put up your sword! No, let them come. If they’ve a mind for it, I’ll try it out with any two together. That’s spoken as I’d have spoken it at your age. But you are in my house. Whatever man Would fight with you shall fight it out with me. They’re dumb, they’re dumb. How many of you would meet           [Draws sword. This mutterer, this old whistler, this sandpiper, This edge that’s greyer than the tide, this mouse That’s gnawing at the timbers of the world, This, this—— Boy, I would meet them all in arms If I’d a son like you. He would avenge me When I have withstood for the last time the men [108]Whose fathers, brothers, sons, and friends I have killed Upholding Conchubar, when the four provinces Have gathered with the ravens over them. But I’d need no avenger. You and I Would scatter them like water from a dish. We’ll stand by one another from this out. Here is the ring. No, turn and turn about. But my turn’s first because I am the older. Nine queens out of the Country-under-Wave Have woven it with the fleeces of the sea And they were long embroidering at it.—Boy, If I had fought my father, he’d have killed me. As certainly as if I had a son And fought with him, I should be deadly to him; For the old fiery fountains are far off And every day there is less heat o’ the blood. No more of this. I will not have this friendship. Cuchulain is my man, and I forbid it. He shall not go unfought, for I myself—[109] I will not have it. You lay commands on me? You shall not stir, High King. I’ll hold you there. Witchcraft has maddened you. Yes, witchcraft! witchcraft! Some witch has worked upon your mind, Cuchulain. The head of that young man seemed like a woman’s You’d had a fancy for. Then of a sudden You laid your hands on the High King himself! And laid my hands on the High King himself?[110] Some witch is floating in the air above us. Yes, witchcraft, witchcraft! Witches of the air!          [To YOUNG MAN. Why did you? Who was it set you to this work? Out, out! I say, for now it’s sword on sword! But . . . but I did not. Out, I say, out, out!I have seen, I have seen![111] What do you cry aloud? The ever-living have shown me what’s to come. How? Where? In the ashes of the bowl. While you were holding it between your hands? Speak quickly! I have seen Cuchulain’s roof-tree Leap into fire, and the walls split and blacken. Cuchulain has gone out to die. O! O![112] Who could have thought that one so great as he Should meet his end at this unnoted sword! Life drifts between a fool and a blind man To the end, and nobody can know his end. Come, look upon the quenching of this greatness. No crying out, for there’ll be need of cries And knocking at the breast when it’s all finished.The dews drop slowly and dreams gather: unknown spears Suddenly hurtle before my dream-awakened eyes, And then the clash of fallen horsemen and the cries Of unknown perishing armies beat about my ears. We who still labour by the cromlec on the shore, The grey cairn on the hill, when day sinks drowned in dew, Being weary of the world’s empires, bow down to you, Master of the still stars and of the flaming door.When you were an acorn on the tree-top, Then was I an eagle cock; Now that you are a withered old block, Still am I an eagle cock.’Twas they that did it, the pale, windy people. Where? where? where? My sword against the thunder! But no, for they have always been my friends; And though they love to blow a smoking coal Till it’s all flame, the wars they blow aflame Are full of glory, and heart-uplifting pride, And not like this. The wars they love awaken Old fingers and the sleepy strings of harps. Who did it, then? Are you afraid? Speak out! For I have put you under my protection, [121]And will reward you well. Dubthach the Chafer? He’d an old grudge. No, for he is with Maeve. Laegaire did it! Why do you not speak? What is this house? [Pause.] Now I remember all.’Twas you who did it—you who sat up there With your old rod of kingship, like a magpie Nursing a stolen spoon. No, not a magpie, A maggot that is eating up the earth! Yes, but a magpie, for he’s flown away. Where did he fly to?I have a story right, my wanderers, [130]That has so mixed with fable in our songs, That all seemed fabulous. We are come, by chance, Into King Conchubar’s country, and this house Is an old guest-house built for travellers From the seashore to Conchubar’s royal house, And there are certain hills among these woods, And there Queen Deirdre grew. That famous queen Who has been wandering with her lover, Naisi, And none to friend but lovers and wild hearts? Some dozen years ago, King Conchubar found A house upon a hillside in this wood, And there a comely child with an old witch To nurse her, and there’s nobody can say If she were human, or of those begot By an invisible king of the air in a storm On a king’s daughter, or anything at all Of who she was or why she was hidden there But that she’d too much beauty for good luck. He went up thither daily, till at last She put on womanhood, and he lost peace, [131]And Deirdre’s tale began. The King was old. A month or so before the marriage day, A young man, in the laughing scorn of his youth, Naisi, the son of Usnach, climbed up there, And having wooed, or, as some say, been wooed, Carried her off. The tale were well enough Had it a finish. Hush! I have more to tell; But gather close that I may whisper it: I speak of terrible, mysterious ends— The secrets of a king. There’s none to hear! I have been to Conchubar’s house, and followed up A crowd of servants going out and in With loads upon their heads: embroideries To hang upon the walls, or new-mown rushes To strew upon the floors, and came at length To a great room.[132] Be silent; there are steps! You are musicians by these instruments, And if as seems—for you are comely women— You can praise love, you’ll have the best of luck, For there’ll be two, before the night is in, That bargained for their love, and paid for it All that men value. You have but the time To weigh a happy music with the sad; To find what is most pleasing to a lover, Before the son of Usnach and his queen Have passed this threshold. Deirdre and her man! I thought to find a message from the king, And ran to meet it. Is there no messenger From Conchubar to Fergus, son of Rogh? I was to have found a message in this house. Are Deirdre and her lover tired of life?[133] You are not of this country, or you’d know That they are in my charge, and all forgiven. We have no country but the roads of the world. Then you should know that all things change in the world, And hatred turns to love and love to hate, And even kings forgive. An old man’s love Who casts no second line, is hard to cure; His jealousy is like his love. And that’s but true. You have learned something in your wanderings. He was so hard to cure, that the whole court, But I alone, thought it impossible; Yet after I had urged it at all seasons, I had my way, and all’s forgiven now; And you shall speak the welcome and the joy That I lack tongue for.[134] Yet old men are jealous. I am Conchubar’s near friend, and that weighed somewhat, And it was policy to pardon them. The need of some young, famous, popular man To lead the troops, the murmur of the crowd, And his own natural impulse, urged him to it. They have been wandering half-a-dozen years. And yet old men are jealous. Sing the more sweetly Because, though age is arid as a bone, This man has flowered. I’ve need of music, too; If this gray head would suffer no reproach, I’d dance and sing—and dance till the hour ran out, Because I have accomplished this good deed. [135]Look there—there at the window, those dark men, With murderous and outlandish-looking arms— They’ve been about the house all day. What are you? Where do you come from, who is it sent you here? They will not answer you. They do not hear. Forgive my open speech, but to these eyes That have seen many lands, they are such men As kings will gather for a murderous task, That neither bribes, commands, nor promises Can bring their people to. And that is why [136]You harped upon an old man’s jealousy. A trifle sets you quaking. Conchubar’s fame Brings merchandise on every wind that blows. They may have brought him Libyan dragon-skin, Or the ivory of the fierce unicorn. If these be merchants, I have seen the goods They have brought to Conchubar, and understood His murderous purpose. Murderous, you say? Why, what new gossip of the roads is this? But I’ll not hear. It may be life or death. There is a room in Conchubar’s house, and there— Be silent, or I’ll drive you from the door. There’s many a one that would do more than that, And make it prison, or death, or banishment To slander the High King. He is my friend; I have his oath, and I am well content. I have known his mind as if it were my own These many years, and there is none alive Shall buzz against him, and I there to stop it. I know myself, and him, and your wild thought Fed on extravagant poetry, and lit By such a dazzle of old fabulous tales That common things are lost, and all that’s strange Is true because ’twere pity if it were not. Quick! quick! your instruments! they are coming now. I hear the hoofs a-clatter. Begin that song; But what is it to be? I’d have them hear A music foaming up out of the house Like wine out of a cup. Come now, a verse Of some old time not worth remembering, And all the lovelier because a bubble. Begin, begin, of some old king and queen, Of Lugaidh Redstripe or another; no, not him, He and his lady perished wretchedly. ‘Why is it,’ Queen Edain said, ‘If I do but climb the stair. . . .’
[138] Ah! that is better. . . . They are alighted now. Shake all your cockscombs, children; these are lovers. ‘Why is it,’ Queen Edain said, ‘If I do but climb the stair To the tower overhead, When the winds are calling there, Or the gannets calling out, In waste places of the sky, There’s so much to think about, That I cry, that I cry?’ But her goodman answered her: ‘Love would be a thing of naught Had not all his limbs a stir Born out of immoderate thought; Were he anything by half, Were his measure running dry. Lovers, if they may not laugh, Have to cry, have to cry.’ But is Edain worth a song Now the hunt begins anew? Praise the beautiful and strong; Praise the redness of the yew; Praise the blossoming apple-stem. But our silence had been wise. What is all our praise to them, That have one another’s eyes? You are welcome, lady. Conchubar has not come. Were the peace honest, he’d have come himself To prove it so. [140]Being no more in love, He stays in his own house, arranging where The curlew and the plover go, and where The speckled heath-cock in a golden dish. But there’s no messenger. He’ll come himself When all’s in readiness and night closed in; But till that hour, these birds out of the waste Shall put his heart and mind into the music. There’s many a day that I have almost wept To think that one so delicately made Might never know the sweet and natural life Of women born to that magnificence, Quiet and music, courtesy and peace. I have found life obscure and violent, And think it ever so; but none the less I thank you for your kindness, and thank these That put it into music. Your house has been The hole of the badger or the den of the fox; [141]But all that’s finished, and your days will pass From this day out where life is smooth on the tongue, Because the grapes were trodden long ago. If I was childish, and had faith in omens, I’d rather not have lit on that old chessboard At my home-coming. There’s a tale about it— It has been lying there these many years— Some wild old sorrowful tale. It is the board Where Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his, Who had a seamew’s body half the year, Played at the chess upon the night they died. I can remember now a tale of treachery, A broken promise and a journey’s end; But it were best forgot. If the tale is true, [142]When it was plain that they had been betrayed, They moved the men, and waited for the end, As it were bedtime, and had so quiet minds They hardly winked their eyes when the sword flashed. She never could have played so, being a woman, If she had not the cold sea’s blood in her. I have heard that th’ ever-living warn mankind By changing clouds, and casual accidents, Or what seem so. If there had been ill luck In lighting on this chessboard of a sudden, This flagon that stood on it when we came Has made all right again, for it should mean All wrongs forgiven, hospitality For bitter memory, peace after war, While that loaf there should add prosperity. Deirdre will see the world, as it were, new-made, If she’ll but eat and drink. The flagon’s dry, [143]Full of old cobwebs, and the bread is mouldy, Left by some traveller gone upon his way These many weeks. No one to welcome us, And a bare house upon the journey’s end. Is that the welcome that a king spreads out For those that he would honour? Hush! no more. You are King Conchubar’s guest, being in his house. You speak as women do that sit alone, Marking the ashes with a stick till they Are in a dreamy terror. Being a queen, You should have too calm thought to start at shadows. Come, let us look if there’s a messenger From Conchubar’s house. A little way without One sees the road for half a mile or so, Where the trees thin or thicken. When those we love Speak words unfitting to the ear of kings, Kind ears are deaf.[144] Before you came I had to threaten these that would have weighed Some crazy phantasy of their own brain Or gossip of the road with Conchubar’s word. If I had thought so little of mankind I never could have moved him to this pardon. I have believed the best of every man, And find that to believe it is enough To make a bad man show him at his best, Or even a good man swing his lantern higher. If anything lies heavy on your heart, Speak freely of it, knowing it is certain That you will never see my face again. You’ve been in love? [145]If you would speak of love, Speak freely. There is nothing in the world That has been friendly to us but the kisses That were upon our lips, and when we are old Their memory will be all the life we have. There was a man that loved me. He was old; I could not love him. Now I can but fear. He has made promises, and brought me home; But though I turn it over in my thoughts, I cannot tell if they are sound and wholesome, Or hackles on the hook. I have heard he loved you, As some old miser loves the dragon-stone He hides among the cobwebs near the roof. You mean that when a man who has loved like that Is after crossed, love drowns in its own flood, And that love drowned and floating is but hate. And that a king who hates, sleeps ill at night, Till he has killed, and that, though the day laughs, We shall be dead at cockcrow.[146] You have not my thought. When I lost one I loved distractedly, I blamed my crafty rival and not him, And fancied, till my passion had run out, That could I carry him away with me, And tell him all my love, I’d keep him yet. Ah! now I catch your meaning, that this king Will murder Naisi, and keep me alive. ’Tis you that put that meaning upon words Spoken at random. Wanderers like you, Who have their wit alone to keep their lives, Speak nothing that is bitter to the ear At random; if they hint at it at all Their eyes and ears have gathered it so lately That it is crying out in them for speech. We have little that is certain.[147] Certain or not, Speak it out quickly, I beseech you to it; I never have met any of your kind, But that I gave them money, food, and fire. There are strange, miracle-working, wicked stones, Men tear out of the heart and the hot brain Of Libyan dragons. The hot Istain stone, And the cold stone of Fanes, that have power To stir even those at enmity to love. They have so great an influence, if but sewn In the embroideries that curtain in The bridal bed. O Mover of the stars That made this delicate house of ivory, And made my soul its mistress, keep it safe. [148]I have seen a bridal bed, so curtained in, So decked for miracle in Conchubar’s house, And learned that a bride’s coming. And I the bride? Here is worse treachery than the seamew suffered, For she but died and mixed into the dust Of her dear comrade, but I am to live And lie in the one bed with him I hate. Where is Naisi? I was not alone like this When Conchubar first chose me for his wife; I cried in sleeping or waking and he came, But now there is worse need. Why have you called? I was but standing there, without the door. The horses are still saddled, follow me, And hurry to our ships, and get us gone. There’s naught to fear; the king’s forgiven all. [149]She has the heart of a wild bird that fears The net of the fowler or the wicker cage, And has been ever so. Although it’s hard, It is but needful that I stand against you, And if I did not you’d despise me for it, As women do the husbands that they lead Whether for good or evil. I have heard Monstrous, terrible, mysterious things, Magical horrors and the spells of wizards. Why, that’s no wonder, you’ve been listening To singers of the roads that gather up The tales of the whole world, and when they weary Imagine new, or lies about the living, Because their brains are ever upon fire. Is then the king that sends no messenger, And leaves an empty house before a guest, So clear in all he does that no dim word Can light us to a doubt? However dim, [150]Speak it, for I have known King Conchubar Better than my own heart, and I can quench Whatever words have made you doubt him. No, I cannot weigh the gossip of the roads With a king’s word, and were the end but death, I may not doubt him. Naisi, I must speak. Let us begone, this house is no fit place, Being full of doubt—Deirdre is right. No, no, Not by that door that opens on the path That runs to the seashore, but this that leads To Conchubar’s house. We’ll wait no messenger, But go to his well-lighted house, and there Where the rich world runs up into a wick And that burns steadily, because no wind Can blow upon it, bring all doubts to an end. The table has been spread by this, the court Has ridden from all sides to welcome you To safety and to peace.[151] Safety and peace! I had them when a child, but never since. Men blame you that you have stirred a quarrel up That has brought death to many. I have poured Water upon the fire, but if you fly A second time the house is in a blaze And all the screaming household can but blame The savage heart of beauty for it all; And Naisi that but helped to tar the wisp Be but a hunted outlaw all his days. I will be blamed no more! there’s but one way. I’ll spoil this beauty that brought misery And houseless wandering on the man I loved, And so buy peace between him and the king. These wanderers will show me how to do it, To clip my hair to baldness, blacken my skin With walnut juice, and tear my face with briars. Oh! that wild creatures of the woods had torn This body with their claws. What is your meaning? What are you saying? That he loves you still?[152] Whatever were to happen to this face, I’d be myself; and there’s not any way But this way to bring trouble to an end. Answer me—does King Conchubar still love— Does he still covet you? Tell out the plot, The plan, the network, all the treachery, And of the bridal chamber and the bed, The magical stones, the wizard’s handiwork. Take care of Deirdre, if I die in this, For she must never fall into his hands, Whatever the cost. Where would you go to, Naisi? I go to drag the truth from Conchubar, Before his people, in the face of his army, And if it be as black as you have made it, To kill him there.[153] You never would return; I’d never look upon your face again. Oh, keep him, Fergus; do not let him go, But hold him from it. You are both wise and kind. When you were all but Conchubar’s wife, I took you; He tried to kill me, and he would have done it If I had been so near as I am now. And now that you are mine, he has planned to take you. Should I be less than Conchubar, being a man? Supper is on the table; Conchubar Is waiting for his guests. All’s well, again! All’s well! all’s well! You cried your doubts so loud, That I had almost doubted.[154] I would have killed him, And he the while but busy in his house For the more welcome. The message is not finished. Come quickly. Conchubar will laugh, that I— Although I held out boldly in my speech— That I, even I— Wait, wait! He is not done. That am so great a friend, have doubted him. Deirdre, and Fergus, son of Rogh, are summoned; But not the traitor that bore off the queen. It is enough that the king pardon her, And call her to his table and his bed. So, then, it’s treachery.[155] I’ll not believe it. Tell Conchubar to meet me in some place Where none can come between us but our swords. I have done my message; I am Conchubar’s man; I take no message from a traitor’s lips. No, but you must; and I will have you swear To carry it unbroken. He has been suborned. I know King Conchubar’s mind as it were my own; I’ll learn the truth from him. No, no, old man, You thought the best, and the worst came of it; We listened to the counsel of the wise, And so turned fools. But ride and bring your friends. Go, and go quickly. Conchubar has not seen me; It may be that his passion is asleep, And that we may escape. But I’ll go first, And follow up that Libyan heel, and send Such words to Conchubar, that he may know At how great peril he lays hands upon you. The Libyan, knowing that a servant’s life Is safe from hands like mine, but turned and mocked. I’ll call my friends, and call the reaping-hooks, And carry you in safety to the ships. My name has still some power. I will protect, Or, if that is impossible, revenge. The crib has fallen and the birds are in it; There is not one of the great oaks about us But shades a hundred men. Let’s out and die, Or break away, if the chance favour us. They would but drag you from me, stained with blood. Their barbarous weapons would but mar that beauty, And I would have you die as a queen should— In a death chamber. You are in my charge. We will wait here, and when they come upon us, I’ll hold them from the doors, and when that’s over, Give you a cleanly death with this grey edge. I will stay here; but you go out and fight. Our way of life has brought no friends to us, And if we do not buy them leaving it, We shall be ever friendless.[158] What do they say? That Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his Sat at this chessboard, waiting for their end. They knew that there was nothing that could save them, And so played chess as they had any night For years, and waited for the stroke of sword. I never heard a death so out of reach Of common hearts, a high and comely end: What need have I, that gave up all for love, To die like an old king out of a fable, Fighting and passionate? What need is there For all that ostentation at my setting? I have loved truly and betrayed no man. I need no lightning at the end, no beating In a vain fury at the cage’s door. Had you been here when that man and his queen Played at so high a game, could you have found An ancient poem for the praise of it? It should have set out plainly that those two, Because no man and woman have loved better, Might sit on there contentedly, and weigh The joy comes after. I have heard the seamew [159]Sat there, with all the colour in her cheeks, As though she’d say: ‘There’s nothing happening But that a king and queen are playing chess.’ He’s in the right, though I have not been born Of the cold, haughty waves. My veins are hot. But though I have loved better than that queen, I’ll have as quiet fingers on the board. Oh, singing women, set it down in a book That love is all we need, even though it is But the last drops we gather up like this; And though the drops are all we have known of life, For we have been most friendless—praise us for it And praise the double sunset, for naught’s lacking, But a good end to the long, cloudy day. Light torches there and drive the shadows out, For day’s red end comes up. Make no sad music. What is it but a king and queen at chess? They need a music that can mix itself Into imagination, but not break The steady thinking that the hard game needs. Love is an immoderate thing And can never be content, Till it dip an ageing wing, Where some laughing element Leaps and Time’s old lanthorn dims. What’s the merit in love-play, In the tumult of the limbs That dies out before ’tis day, Heart on heart, or mouth on mouth, All that mingling of our breath, When love-longing is but drouth For the things come after death? I cannot go on playing like that woman That had but the cold blood of the sea in her veins.[161] It is your move. Take up your man again. Do you remember that first night in the woods We lay all night on leaves, and looking up, When the first grey of the dawn awoke the birds, Saw leaves above us. You thought that I still slept, And bending down to kiss me on the eyes, Found they were open. Bend and kiss me now, For it may be the last before our death. And when that’s over, we’ll be different; Imperishable things, a cloud or a fire. And I know nothing but this body, nothing But that old vehement, bewildering kiss. Children, beware! He has taken up my challenge; Whether I am a ghost or living man When day has broken, I’ll forget the rest, And say that there is kingly stuff in him. He came to spy upon us, not to fight. A prudent hunter, therefore, but no king. He’d find if what has fallen in the pit Were worth the hunting, but has come too near, And I turn hunter. You’re not man, but beast. Go scurry in the bushes, now, beast, beast, For now it’s topsy-turvy, I upon you. You have a knife there thrust into your girdle. I’d have you give it me. No, but I dare not. No, but you must. If harm should come to you, They’d know I gave it. [163]There is no mark on this To make it different from any other Out of a common forge. You have taken it, I did not give it you; but there are times When such a thing is all the friend one has. The leaves hide all, and there’s no way to find What path to follow. Why is there no sound? Where would you go? To strike a blow for Naisi, If Conchubar call the Libyans to his aid. But why is there no clash? They have met by this! Listen. I am called far-seeing. If Conchubar win, You have a woman’s wile that can do much, Even with men in pride of victory. He is in love and old. What were one knife Among a hundred?[164] Women, if I die, If Naisi die this night, how will you praise? What words seek out? for that will stand to you; For being but dead we shall have many friends. All through your wanderings, the doors of kings Shall be thrown wider open, the poor man’s hearth Heaped with new turf, because you are wearing this            [Gives MUSICIAN a bracelet. To show that you have Deirdre’s story right. Have you not been paid servants in love’s house To sweep the ashes out and keep the doors? And though you have suffered all for mere love’s sake You’d live your lives again. Even this last hour. [165]One woman and two men; that is a quarrel That knows no mending. Bring the man she chose Because of his beauty and the strength of his youth. I have been taken like a bird or a fish. He cried ‘Beast, beast!’ and in a blind-beast rage He ran at me and fell into the nets, But we were careful for your sake, and took him With all the comeliness that woke desire Unbroken in him. I being old and lenient— I would not hurt a hair upon his head. What do you say? Have you forgiven him? He is but mocking us. What’s left to say Now that the seven years’ hunt is at an end? [166]He never doubted you until I made him, And therefore all the blame for what he says Should fall on me. But his young blood is hot, And if we’re of one mind, he shall go free, And I ask nothing for it, or, if something, Nothing I could not take. There is no king In the wide world that, being so greatly wronged, Could copy me, and give all vengeance up. Although her marriage-day had all but come, You carried her away; but I’ll show mercy. Because you had the insolent strength of youth You carried her away; but I’ve had time To think it out through all these seven years. I will show mercy. You have many words. I will not make a bargain; I but ask What is already mine. You may go free If Deirdre will but walk into my house Before the people’s eyes, that they may know When I have put the crown upon her head [167]I have not taken her by force and guile. The doors are open, and the floors are strewed, And in the bridal chamber curtains sewn With all enchantments that give happiness, By races that are germane to the sun, And nearest him, and have no blood in their veins— For when they’re wounded the wound drips with wine— Nor speech but singing. At the bridal door Two fair king’s daughters carry in their hands The crown and robe. Oh, no! Not that, not that. Ask any other thing but that one thing. Leave me with Naisi. We will go away Into some country at the ends of the earth. We’ll trouble you no more. You will be praised By everybody if you pardon us. ‘He is good, he is good,’ they’ll say to one another; ‘There’s nobody like him, for he forgave Deirdre and Naisi.’ Do you think that I [168]Shall let you go again, after seven years Of longing and of planning here and there, And trafficking with merchants for the stones That make all sure, and watching my own face That none might read it? It’s better to go with him. Why should you die when one can bear it all? My life is over; it’s better to obey. Why should you die? I will not live long, Naisi. I’d not have you believe I’d long stay living; Oh no, no, no! You will go far away. You will forget me. Speak, speak, Naisi, speak, And say that it is better that I go. I will not ask it. Do not speak a word, For I will take it all upon myself. Conchubar, I will go. And do you think That, were I given life at such a price, I would not cast it from me? O, my eagle! Why do you beat vain wings upon the rock When hollow night’s above? It’s better, Naisi. [169]It may be hard for you, but you’ll forget. For what am I, to be remembered always? And there are other women. There was one, The daughter of the King of Leodas; I could not sleep because of her. Speak to him; Tell it out plain, and make him understand. And if it be he thinks I shall stay living, Say that I will not. Would I had lost life Among those Scottish kings that sought it of me, Because you were my wife, or that the worst Had taken you before this bargaining! O eagle! if you were to do this thing, And buy my life of Conchubar with your body, Love’s law being broken, I would stand alone Upon the eternal summits, and call out, And you could never come there, being banished. I would obey, but cannot. Pardon us. I know that you are good. I have heard you praised For giving gifts; and you will pardon us, Although I cannot go into your house. It was my fault. I only should be punished. The very moment these eyes fell on him, I told him; I held out my hands to him; How could he refuse? At first he would not— I am not lying—he remembered you. What do I say? My hands?—No, no, my lips— For I had pressed my lips upon his lips— I swear it is not false—my breast to his; Until I woke the passion that’s in all, And how could he resist? I had my beauty. You may have need of him, a brave, strong man, Who is not foolish at the council board, Nor does he quarrel by the candle-light And give hard blows to dogs. A cup of wine Moves him to mirth, not madness. What am I saying? You may have need of him, for you have none Who is so good a sword, or so well loved Among the common people. You may need him, And what king knows when the hour of need may come? You dream that you have men enough. You laugh. [171]Yes; you are laughing to yourself. You say, ‘I am Conchubar—I have no need of him.’ You will cry out for him some day and say, ‘If Naisi were but living’——[She misses NAISI.] Where is he? Where have you sent him? Where is the son of Usna? Where is he, O, where is he? The traitor who has carried off my wife No longer lives. Come to my house now, Deirdre, For he that called himself your husband’s dead. O, do not touch me. Let me go to him. King Conchubar is right. My husband’s dead. A single woman is of no account, Lacking array of servants, linen cupboards, The bacon hanging—and King Conchubar’s house [172]All ready, too—I’ll to King Conchubar’s house. It is but wisdom to do willingly What has to be. But why are you so calm? I thought that you would curse me and cry out, And fall upon the ground and tear your hair. You know too much of women to think so; Though, if I were less worthy of desire, I would pretend as much; but, being myself, It is enough that you were master here. Although we are so delicately made, There’s something brutal in us, and we are won By those who can shed blood. It was some woman That taught you how to woo: but do not touch me, For I’ll go with you and do all your will When I have done whatever’s customary. We lay the dead out, folding up the hands, Closing the eyes, and stretching out the feet, And push a pillow underneath the head, Till all’s in order; and all this I’ll do For Naisi, son of Usna.[173] It is not fitting. You are not now a wanderer, but a queen, And there are plenty that can do these things. No, no. Not yet. I cannot be your queen Till the past’s finished, and its debts are paid. When a man dies and there are debts unpaid, He wanders by the debtor’s bed and cries, There’s so much owing. You are deceiving me. You long to look upon his face again. Why should I give you now to a dead man That took you from a living? In good time. You’ll stir me to more passion than he could, And yet, if you are wise, you’ll grant me this: That I go look upon him that was once So strong and comely and held his head so high That women envied me. For I will see him [174]All blood-bedabbled and his beauty gone. It’s better, when you’re beside me in your strength, That the mind’s eye should call up the soiled body, And not the shape I loved. Look at him, women. He heard me pleading to be given up, Although my lover was still living, and yet He doubts my purpose. I will have you tell him How changeable all women are. How soon Even the best of lovers is forgot, When his day’s finished. No; but I will trust The strength you have spoken of, and not your purpose. I’ll have this gift—the first that I have asked. He has refused. There is no sap in him, Nothing but empty veins. I thought as much. He has refused me the first thing I have asked— Me, me, his wife. I understand him now; I know the sort of life I’ll have with him; [175]But he must drag me to his house by force. If he refuse [she laughs], he shall be mocked of all. They’ll say to one another, ‘Look at him That is so jealous that he lured a man From over sea, and murdered him, and yet He trembled at the thought of a dead face!’ How do I know that you have not some knife, And go to die upon his body? Have me searched, If you would make so little of your queen. It may be that I have a knife hid here Under my dress. Bid one of these dark slaves To search me for it. Go to your farewells, queen. Now strike the wire, and sing to it awhile, Knowing that all is happy, and that you know Within what bride-bed I shall lie this night, [176]And by what man, and lie close up to him, For the bed’s narrow, and there outsleep the cockcrow. [She goes behind the curtain. They are gone, they are gone. The proud may lie by the proud. Though we were bidden to sing, cry nothing loud. They are gone, they are gone. Whispering were enough. Into the secret wilderness of their love. A high, grey cairn. What more is to be said? Eagles have gone into their cloudy bed. Where’s Naisi, son of Usna, and his queen? I and a thousand reaping-hooks and scythes Demand him of you. You have come too late. I have accomplished all. Deirdre is mine; She is my queen, and no man now can rob me. I had to climb the topmost bough and pull This apple among the winds. Open the curtain, That Fergus learn my triumph from her lips. No, no; I’ll not believe it. She is not dead— She cannot have escaped a second time! King, she is dead; but lay no hand upon her. What’s this but empty cage and tangled wire, Now the bird’s gone? but I’ll not have you touch it. You are all traitors, all against me—all. And she has deceived me for a second time. And every common man may keep his wife, But not the King.[178] I have no need of weapons, There’s not a traitor that dare stop my way. Howl, if you will; but I, being king, did right In choosing her most fitting to be queen, And letting no boy lover take the sway.I walked among the seven woods of Coole, Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn; Shady Kyle-dortha; sunnier Kyle-na-gno, Where many hundred squirrels are as happy As though they had been hidden by green boughs, Where old age cannot find them; Pairc-na-lea, Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths; Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling Their sudden fragrances on the green air; Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes Have seen immortal, mild, proud shadows walk; Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox And marten-cat, and borders that old wood Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood: Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods. I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes, Yet dreamed that beings happier than men Moved round me in the shadows, and at night My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires; And the images I have woven in this story Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters Moved round me in the voices and the fires, And more I may not write of, for they that cleave The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue [182]Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence. How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows? I only know that all we know comes from you, And that you come from Eden on flying feet. Is Eden far away, or do you hide From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys That run before the reaping-hook and lie In the last ridge of the barley? Do our woods And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods, More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds? Is Eden out of time and out of space? And do you gather about us when pale light Shining on water and fallen among leaves, And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?I have made this poem for you, that men may read it Before they read of Forgael and Dectora, As men in the old times, before the harps began, Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.Edain came out of Midher’s hill, and lay Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass, Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds And druid moons, and murmuring of boughs, And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made Of opal and ruby and pale chrysolite Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings, Sweet with all music, out of his long hair, Because her hands had been made wild by love; When Midher’s wife had changed her to a fly, He made a harp with druid apple wood That she among her winds might know he wept; And from that hour he has watched over none But faithful lovers.[184]Has he not led us into these waste seas For long enough?[186] Aye, long and long enough. We have not come upon a shore or ship These dozen weeks. And I had thought to make A good round sum upon this cruise, and turn— For I am getting on in life—to something That has less ups and downs than robbery. I am so lecherous with abstinence I’d give the profit of nine voyages For that red Moll that had but the one eye. And all the ale ran out at the new moon; And now that time puts water in my blood, The ale cup is my father and my mother. It would be better to turn home again, Whether he will or no; and better still To make an end while he is sleeping there. If we were of one mind I’d do it.[187] Were’t not That there is magic in that harp of his, That makes me fear to raise a hand against him, I would be of your mind; but when he plays it Strange creatures flutter up before one’s eyes, Or cry about one’s ears. Nothing to fear. Do you remember when we sank that galley At the full moon? He played all through the night. Until the moon had set; and when I looked Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird Like a grey gull upon the breast of each. While I was looking they rose hurriedly, And after circling with strange cries awhile Flew westward; and many a time since then I’ve heard a rustling overhead in the wind.[188] I saw them on that night as well as you. But when I had eaten and drunk a bellyful My courage came again. But that’s not all. The other night, while he was playing it, A beautiful young man and girl came up In a white, breaking wave; they had the look Of those that are alive for ever and ever. I saw them, too, one night. Forgael was playing, And they were listening there beyond the sail. He could not see them, but I held out my hands To grasp the woman. You have dared to touch her? O, she was but a shadow, and slipped from me. But were you not afraid? Why should I fear?[189] ’Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering lovers, To whom all lovers pray. But what of that? A shadow does not carry sword or spear. My mother told me that there is not one Of the ever-living half so dangerous As that wild Aengus. Long before her day He carried Edain off from a king’s house, And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone And in a tower of glass, and from that day Has hated every man that’s not in love, And has been dangerous to him. I have heard He does not hate seafarers as he hates Peaceable men that shut the wind away, And keep to the one weary marriage-bed. I think that he has Forgael in his net, And drags him through the sea.[190] Well, net or none, I’d kill him while we have the chance to do it. It’s certain I’d sleep easier o’ nights If he were dead; but who will be our captain, Judge of the stars, and find a course for us? I’ve thought of that. We must have Aibric with us, For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.Become our captain, Aibric. I am resolved To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps. There’s not a man but will be glad of it When it is over, nor one to grumble at us. You’ll have the captain’s share of everything. Silence! for you have taken Forgael’s pay. We joined him for his pay, but have had none [191]This long while now; we had not turned against him If he had brought us among peopled seas, For that was in the bargain when we struck it. What good is there in this hard way of living, Unless we drain more flagons in a year And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men In their long lives? If you’ll be of our troop You’ll be as good a leader. Be of your troop! No, nor with a hundred men like you, When Forgael’s in the other scale. I’d say it Even if Forgael had not been my master From earliest childhood, but that being so, If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard I’ll give my answer. You have awaked him. We’d better go, for we have lost this chance. Have the birds passed us? I could hear your voice. But there were others.[192] I have seen nothing pass. You’re certain of it? I never wake from sleep But that I am afraid they may have passed, For they’re my only pilots. If I lost them Straying too far into the north or south, I’d never come upon the happiness That has been promised me. I have not seen them These many days; and yet there must be many Dying at every moment in the world, And flying towards their peace. Put by these thoughts, And listen to me for awhile. The sailors Are plotting for your death. Have I not given More riches than they ever hoped to find? And now they will not follow, while I seek The only riches that have hit my fancy. What riches can you find in this waste sea [193]Where no ship sails, where nothing that’s alive Has ever come but those man-headed birds, Knowing it for the world’s end? Where the world ends The mind is made unchanging, for it finds Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope, The flagstone under all, the fire of fires, The roots of the world. Who knows that shadows May not have driven you mad for their own sport? Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their plot? No, no, do not say that. You know right well That I will never lift a hand against you. Why should you be more faithful than the rest, Being as doubtful? I have called you master Too many years to lift a hand against you.[194] Maybe it is but natural to doubt me. You’ve never known, I’d lay a wager on it, A melancholy that a cup of wine, A lucky battle, or a woman’s kiss Could not amend. I have good spirits enough. I’ve nothing to complain of but heartburn, And that is cured by a boiled liquorice root. If you will give me all your mind awhile— All, all, the very bottom of the bowl— I’ll show you that I am made differently, That nothing can amend it but these waters, Where I am rid of life—the events of the world— What do you call it?—that old promise-breaker, The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering, ‘You will have all you have wished for when you have earned Land for your children or money in a pot.’ And when we have it we are no happier, Because of that old draught under the door, [195]Or creaky shoes. And at the end of all We have been no better off than Seaghan the fool, That never did a hand’s turn. Aibric! Aibric! We have fallen in the dreams the ever-living Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world, And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh, And find their laughter sweeter to the taste For that brief sighing. If you had loved some woman— You say that also? You have heard the voices, For that is what they say—all, all the shadows— Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers, And all the others; but it must be love As they have known it. Now the secret’s out; For it is love that I am seeking for, But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind That is not in the world. And yet the world Has beautiful women to please every man. [196]But he that gets their love after the fashion Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope And bodily tenderness, and finds that even The bed of love, that in the imagination Had seemed to be the giver of all peace, Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting, And as soon finished. All that ever loved Have loved that way—there is no other way. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they Believed there was some other near at hand, And almost wept because they could not find it. When they have twenty years; in middle life They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth, And let the dream go by. It’s not a dream, But the reality that makes our passion As a lamp shadow—no—no lamp, the sun. What the world’s million lips are thirsting for, Must be substantial somewhere.[197] I have heard the Druids Mutter such things as they awake from trance. It may be that the ever-living know it— No mortal can. Yes; if they give us help. They are besotting you as they besot The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows That he has been all night upon the hills, Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host With the ever-living. What if he speak the truth, And for a dozen hours have been a part Of that more powerful life? His wife knows better. Has she not seen him lying like a log, Or fumbling in a dream about the house? And if she hear him mutter of wild riders, She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing That set him to the fancy.[198] All would be well Could we but give us wholly to the dreams, And get into their world that to the sense Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly Among substantial things; for it is dreams That lift us to the flowing, changing world That the heart longs for. What is love itself, Even though it be the lightest of light love, But dreams that hurry from beyond the world To make low laughter more than meat and drink, Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer, Could we but mix ourselves into a dream, Not in its image on the mirror! While We’re in the body that’s impossible. And yet I cannot think they’re leading me To death; for they that promised to me love As those that can outlive the moon have known it, Had the world’s total life gathered up, it seemed, [199]Into their shining limbs—I’ve had great teachers. Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave— You’d never doubt that it was life they promised Had you looked on them face to face as I did, With so red lips, and running on such feet, And having such wide-open, shining eyes. It’s certain they are leading you to death. None but the dead, or those that never lived, Can know that ecstasy. Forgael! Forgael! They have made you follow the man-headed birds, And you have told me that their journey lies Towards the country of the dead. What matter If I am going to my death, for there, Or somewhere, I shall find the love they have promised. That much is certain. I shall find a woman, One of the ever-living, as I think— One of the laughing people—and she and I Shall light upon a place in the world’s core, Where passion grows to be a changeless thing, Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase, Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysolite; [200]And there, in juggleries of sight and sense, Become one movement, energy, delight, Until the overburthened moon is dead. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice! And we are almost on her! We had not known But for the ambergris and sandalwood. No; but opoponax and cinnamon. The ever-living have kept my bargain for me, And paid you on the nail. Take up that rope To make her fast while we are plundering her. There is a king and queen upon her deck, And where there is one woman there’ll be others.[201] Speak lower, or they’ll hear. They cannot hear; They are too busy with each other. Look! He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips. When she finds out we have better men aboard She may not be too sorry in the end. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens Care more about the kegs of silver and gold, And the high fame that come to them in marriage, Than a strong body and a ready hand. There’s nobody is natural but a robber, And that is why the world totters about Upon its bandy legs. Run at them now, And overpower the crew while yet asleep! Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain! Wake all below! Why have you broken our sleep? Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain! There! there they come! Gull, gannet, or diver, But with a man’s head, or a fair woman’s, They hover over the masthead awhile To wait their friends; but when their friends have come They’ll fly upon that secret way of theirs. One—and one—a couple—five together; And I will hear them talking in a minute. [203]Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words. Now I can hear. There’s one of them that says: ‘How light we are, now we are changed to birds!’ Another answers: ‘Maybe we shall find Our heart’s desire now that we are so light.’ And then one asks another how he died, And says: ‘A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.’ And now they all wheel suddenly and fly To the other side, and higher in the air. And now a laggard with a woman’s head Comes crying, ‘I have run upon the sword. I have fled to my beloved in the air, In the waste of the high air, that we may wander Among the windy meadows of the dawn.’ But why are they still waiting? why are they Circling and circling over the masthead? What power that is more mighty than desire To hurry to their hidden happiness Withholds them now? Have the ever-living ones A meaning in that circling overhead? But what’s the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you linger there? Why do you not run to your desire, Now that you have happy winged bodies? Being too busy in the air and the high air, They cannot hear my voice; but what’s the meaning? Why are you standing with your eyes upon me? You are not the world’s core. O no, no, no! That cannot be the meaning of the birds. You are not its core. My teeth are in the world, But have not bitten yet. I am a queen, And ask for satisfaction upon these Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me. Let go my hands! [205]Why do you cast a shadow? Where do you come from? Who brought you to this place? They would not send me one that casts a shadow. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships, And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations, And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow, Had drowned me also. But, being yet alive, I ask a fitting punishment for all That raised their hands against him. There are some That weigh and measure all in these waste seas— They that have all the wisdom that’s in life, And all that prophesying images Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs; They have it that the plans of kings and queens Are dust on the moth’s wing; that nothing matters But laughter and tears—laughter, laughter, and tears; That every man should carry his own soul Upon his shoulders. [206]You’ve nothing but wild words, And I would know if you will give me vengeance. When she finds out I will not let her go— When she knows that. What is it that you are muttering— That you’ll not let me go? I am a queen. Although you are more beautiful than any, I almost long that it were possible; But if I were to put you on that ship, With sailors that were sworn to do your will, And you had spread a sail for home, a wind Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge, It had washed among the stars and put them out, And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine, Until you stood before me on the deck— As now. Does wandering in these desolate seas And listening to the cry of wind and wave Bring madness? Queen, I am not mad.[207] And yet you say the water and the wind Would rise against me. No, I am not mad— If it be not that hearing messages From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon, At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken. And did those watchers bid you take me captive? Both you and I are taken in the net. It was their hands that plucked the winds awake And blew you hither; and their mouths have promised I shall have love in their immortal fashion. They gave me that old harp of the nine spells That is more mighty than the sun and moon, Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars, That none might take you from me. For a moment [208]Your raving of a message and a harp More mighty than the stars half troubled me. But all that’s raving. Who is there can compel The daughter and granddaughter of kings To be his bedfellow? Until your lips Have called me their beloved, I’ll not kiss them. My husband and my king died at my feet, And yet you talk of love. The movement of time Is shaken in these seas, and what one does One moment has no might upon the moment That follows after. I understand you now. You have a Druid craft of wicked sound Wrung from the cold women of the sea— A magic that can call a demon up, Until my body give you kiss for kiss. Your soul shall give the kiss.[209] I am not afraid, While there’s a rope to run into a noose Or wave to drown. But I have done with words, And I would have you look into my face And know that it is fearless. Do what you will, For neither I nor you can break a mesh Of the great golden net that is about us. There’s nothing in the world that’s worth a fear. I have good reason for that thought. And now I can put fear away as a queen should. Fool, fool! Although you have looked into my face You do not see my purpose. I shall have gone Before a hand can touch me.[210] My hands are still; The ever-living hold us. Do what you will, You cannot leap out of the golden net. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon us And measure out a course and bring us home, We’ll put this man to death. I promise it. There is none to take his side. I am on his side. I’ll strike a blow for him to give him time To cast his dreams away. No other’ll do it. He has put a sudden darkness over the moon. Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn To him that strikes him first! I will strike him first. [Shrinking back.] He has caught the crescent moon out of the sky, And carries it between us. Holy fire Has come into the jewels of the harp To burn us to the marrow if we strike. I’ll give a golden galley full of fruit, That has the heady flavour of new wine, To him that wounds him to the death. I’ll do it. For all his spells will vanish when he dies, Having their life in him.[212] Though it be the moon That he is holding up between us there, I will strike at him. And I! And I! And I! But you were saying there is somebody Upon that other ship we are to wake. You did not know what brought him to his end, But it was sudden. You are in the right; I had forgotten that we must go wake him. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air, And set you dreaming. How can we have a wake When we have neither brown nor yellow ale? I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.[213] How can we raise the keen that do not know What name to call him by? Come to his ship. His name will come into our thoughts in a minute. I know that he died a thousand years ago, And has not yet been waked. Ohone! O! O! O! The yew bough has been broken into two, And all the birds are scattered. O! O! O! O! Protect me now, gods, that my people swear by. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is! Queen, give it me. No, I have need of it. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it, Now that he’s dead I have no need of it, For everything is gone. Come hither, Aibric, And tell me who it is that we are waking. What name had that dead king? Arthur of Britain? No, no—not Arthur. I remember now. It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died Brokenhearted, having lost his queen Through wicked spells. That is not all the tale, For he was killed. O! O! O! O! O! O! For golden-armed Iollan has been killed. I will end all your magic on the instant. This sword is to lie beside him in the grave. It was in all his battles. I will spread my hair, And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly, For I have heard that he was proud and laughing, Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet, And that he died a thousand years ago. O! O! O! But no, that is not it. I knew him well, and while I heard him laughing They killed him at my feet. O! O! O! O! For golden-armed Iollan that I loved. But what is it that made me say I loved him? It was that harper put it in my thoughts, But it is true. Why did they run upon him, And beat the golden helmet with their swords?[216] Do you not know me, lady? I am he That you are weeping for. No, for he is dead. O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan. It was so given out, but I will prove That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy Have buried nothing but my golden arms. Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon And you will recollect my face and voice, For you have listened to me playing it These thousand years. What are the birds at there? Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden? What are you calling out above the mast? If railing and reproach and mockery Because I have awakened her to love My magic strings, I’ll make this answer to it: Being driven on by voices and by dreams [217]That were clear messages from the ever-living, I have done right. What could I but obey? And yet you make a clamour of reproach. Why, it’s a wonder out of reckoning That I should keen him from the full of the moon To the horn, and he be hale and hearty. How have I wronged her now that she is merry? But no, no, no! your cry is not against me. You know the councils of the ever-living, And all that tossing of your wings is joy, And all that murmuring’s but a marriage song; But if it be reproach, I answer this: There is not one among you that made love By any other means. You call it passion, Consideration, generosity; But it was all deceit, and flattery To win a woman in her own despite, For love is war, and there is hatred in it; And if you say that she came willingly— Why do you turn away and hide your face, That I would look upon for ever?[218] My grief. Have I not loved you for a thousand years? I never have been golden-armed Iollan. I do not understand. I know your face Better than my own hands. I have deceived you Out of all reckoning. Is it not true That you were born a thousand years ago, In islands where the children of Aengus wind In happy dances under a windy moon, And that you’ll bring me there? I have deceived you; I have deceived you utterly. How can that be? [219]Is it that though your eyes are full of love Some other woman has a claim on you, And I’ve but half? Oh, no! And if there is, If there be half a hundred more, what matter? I’ll never give another thought to it; No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak. Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted, Their heads being turned with praise and flattery; And that is why their lovers are afraid To tell them a plain story. That’s not the story; But I have done so great a wrong against you, There is no measure that it would not burst. I will confess it all. What do I care, Now that my body has begun to dream, And you have grown to be a burning sod [220]In the imagination and intellect? If something that’s most fabulous were true— If you had taken me by magic spells, And killed a lover or husband at my feet— I would not let you speak, for I would know That it was yesterday and not to-day I loved him; I would cover up my ears, As I am doing now. [A pause.] Why do you weep? I weep because I’ve nothing for your eyes But desolate waters and a battered ship. O, why do you not lift your eyes to mine? I weep—I weep because bare night’s above, And not a roof of ivory and gold. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof, And strike the golden pillars with my hands. I would that there was nothing in the world But my beloved—that night and day had perished, And all that is and all that is to be, All that is not the meeting of our lips.[221] I too, I too. Why do you look away? Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon My enemy? I looked upon the moon, Longing to knead and pull it into shape That I might lay it on your head as a crown. But now it is your thoughts that wander away, For you are looking at the sea. Do you not know How great a wrong it is to let one’s thought Wander a moment when one is in love? Why are you looking at the sea? Look there! What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds That fly into the west? But listen, listen! What is there but the crying of the birds?[222] If you’ll but listen closely to that crying You’ll hear them calling out to one another With human voices. O, I can hear them now. What are they? Unto what country do they fly? To unimaginable happiness. They have been circling over our heads in the air, But now that they have taken to the road We have to follow, for they are our pilots; And though they’re but the colour of grey ash, They’re crying out, could you but hear their words, ‘There is a country at the end of the world Where no child’s born but to outlive the moon.’ The hold is full of treasure. Full to the hatches.[223] Treasure and treasure. Boxes of precious spice. Ivory images with amethyst eyes. Dragons with eyes of ruby. The whole ship Flashes as if it were a net of herrings. Let’s home; I’d give some rubies to a woman. There’s somebody I’d give the amethyst eyes to. Let’s home and spend it in our villages. We would return to our own country, Forgael, [224]For we have found a treasure that’s so great Imagination cannot reckon it. And having lit upon this woman there, What more have you to look for on the seas? I cannot—I am going on to the end. As for this woman, I think she is coming with me. The ever-living have made you mad; but no, It was this woman in her woman’s vengeance That drove you to it, and I fool enough To fancy that she’d bring you home again. ’Twas you that egged him to it, for you know That he is being driven to his death. That is not true, for he has promised me An unimaginable happiness. And if that happiness be more than dreams, More than the froth, the feather, the dustwhirl, The crazy nothing that I think it is, It shall be in the country of the dead, If there be such a country. No, not there, [225]But in some island where the life of the world Leaps upward, as if all the streams o’ the world Had run into one fountain. Speak to him. He knows that he is taking you to death; Speak—he will not deny it. Is that true? I do not know for certain, but I know That I have the best of pilots. Shadows, illusions, That the shape-changers, the ever-laughing ones, The immortal mockers have cast into his mind, Or called before his eyes. O carry me To some sure country, some familiar place. Have we not everything that life can give In having one another?[226] How could I rest If I refused the messengers and pilots With all those sights and all that crying out? But I will cover up your eyes and ears, That you may never hear the cry of the birds, Or look upon them. Were they but lowlier I’d do your will, but they are too high—too high. Being too high, their heady prophecies But harry us with hopes that come to nothing, Because we are not proud, imperishable, Alone and winged. Our love shall be like theirs When we have put their changeless image on. I am a woman, I die at every breath.[227] Let the birds scatter for the tree is broken. And there’s no help in words. [To the SAILORS.] To the other ship, And I will follow you and cut the rope When I have said farewell to this man here, For neither I nor any living man Will look upon his face again. Go with him, For he will shelter you and bring you home. I’ll do it for his sake. No. Take this sword And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael. The yew bough has been broken into two, And all the birds are scattered—O! O! O! Farewell! farewell! The sword is in the rope— The rope’s in two—it falls into the sea, It whirls into the foam. O ancient worm, Dragon that loved the world and held us to it, You are broken, you are broken. The world drifts away, And I am left alone with my beloved, Who cannot put me from his sight for ever. We are alone for ever, and I laugh, Forgael, because you cannot put me from you. The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I Shall be alone for ever. We two—this crown— I half remember. It has been in my dreams. Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it. O flower of the branch, O bird among the leaves, O silver fish that my two hands have taken Out of the running stream, O morning star, Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn Upon the misty border of the wood, Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair, For we will gaze upon this world no longer. Beloved, having dragged the net about us, And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal; And that old harp awakens of itself To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams, That have had dreams for father, live in us.Silence your music, though I thank you for it; But the wind’s blown upon my hair, and I Must set the jewels on my neck and head For one that’s coming.[252] Your colour has all gone As ’twere with fear, and there’s no cause for that. These women have the raddle that they use To make them brave and confident, although Dread, toil or cold may chill the blood o’ their cheeks. You’ll help me, women. It is my husband’s will I show my trust in one that may be here Before the mind can call the colour up. My husband took these rubies from a king Of Surracha that was so murderous He seemed all glittering dragon. Now wearing them Myself wars on myself, for I myself— That do my husband’s will, yet fear to do it— Grow dragonish to myself.If this importunate heart trouble your peace With words lighter than air, Or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease; Crumple the rose in your hair; And cover your lips with odorous twilight and say, ‘O Hearts of wind-blown flame! O Winds, elder than changing of night and day, That murmuring and longing came, From marble cities loud with tabors of old In dove-gray faery lands; From battle banners, fold upon purple fold, Queens wrought with glimmering hands; That saw young Niamh hover with love-lorn face Above the wandering tide; And lingered in the hidden desolate place, Where the last Phœnix died [26]And wrapped the flames above his holy head; And still murmur and long: O Piteous Hearts, changing till change be dead In a tumultuous song’: And cover the pale blossoms of your breast With your dim heavy hair, And trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest The odorous twilight there.We’ll play at chess Till the king come. It is but natural That she should fear him, for her house has been The hole of the badger and the den of the fox. If I were childish and had faith in omens I’d rather not have lit on that old chessboard At my homecoming. There’s a tale about it,— It has been lying there these many years,— Some wild old sorrowful tale. It is the board Where Lugaidh Redstripe and that wife of his Who had a seamew’s body half the year Played at the chess upon the night they died. I can remember now: a tale of treachery, A broken promise and a journey’s end. But it were best forgot.If the tale’s true,— When it was plain that they had been betrayed, They moved the men and waited for the end As it were bedtime, and had so quiet minds They hardly winked their eyes when the sword flashed. She never could have played so, being a woman, If she had not the cold sea’s blood in her. I have heard the ever-living warn mankind By changing clouds and casual accidents Or what seem so. Stood th’ ever-living there, Old Lir and Aengus from his glassy tower, And that hill-haunting Bodb to warn us hence,— Our honour is so knitted up with staying, King Conchubar’s word and Fergus’ word being pledged, I’d brave them out and stay. No welcomer, And a bare house upon the journey’s end! Is that the way a king that means no wrong Honours a guest? He is but making ready A welcome in his house, arranging where The moorhen and the mallard go, and where The speckled heath-cock in a golden dish. Has he no messenger—‘Safety and peace! I had them when a child, but from that hour I have found life obscure and violent, And think that I shall find it so for ever.’‘The sorrowful are dumb for thee.’All that will give me help. Rafael keep him Wednesday, Sachiel feed him Thursday, Hamiel provide him Friday, Cassiel increase him Saturday.Come, all ye airy bachelors, A warning take by me, A sergeant caught me fowling, And fired his gun so free.His comrades came to his relief, And I was soon trepanned, And bound up like a woodcock Had fallen into their hands.The judge said transportation, The ship was on the strand; They have yoked me to the traces For to plough Van Dieman’s Land!When the Lion will lose his strength, And the braket-thistle begin to pine, The harp shall sound sweet, sweet at length, Between the eight and the nine![Sings.] Oh, Johnny Gibbons, it’s you were the prop to us. You to have left us, we are put astray!I dreamed that I stood in a valley, and amid sighs, For happy lovers passed two by two where I stood; And I dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the wood With her cloud-pale eyelids falling on dream-dimmed eyes: I cried in my dream, O women, bid the young men lay Their heads on your knees, and drown their eyes with your hair, Or remembering hers they will find no other face fair Till all the valleys of the world have been withered away.Our hope and our darling, our heart dies with you, You to have failed us, we are foals astray![207]Pour sauver les pauvres qu’elle aime Ketty donna Son esprit, sa croyance même; Satan paya Cette âme au dévoûment sublime, En écus d’or, Disons pour racheter son crime Confiteor.Mais l’ange qui se fit coupable Par charité Au séjour d’amour ineffable Est remonté.

Witches that steal the milk, Fomor that steal the children, Hags that have heads like hares, Hares that have claws like witches, All riding a-cock-horse, Out of the very bottom of the bitter black north.May this fire have driven out The shape-changers that can put Ruin on a great king’s house, Until all be ruinous. Names whereby a man has known The threshold and the hearthstone, Gather on the wind and drive Women none can kiss and thrive, For they are but whirling wind, Out of memory and mind. They would make a prince decay With light images of clay Planted in the running wave; Or for many shapes they have, They would change them into hounds Until he had died of his wounds Though the change were but a whim; Or they’d hurl a spell at him, That he follow with desire Bodies that can never tire Or grow kind, for they anoint All their bodies joint by joint With a miracle-working juice [227]That is made out of the grease Of the ungoverned unicorn; But the man is thrice forlorn Emptied, ruined, wracked, and lost, That they follow, for at most They will give him kiss for kiss While they murmur “After this Hatred may be sweet to the taste;” Those wild hands that have embraced All his body can but shove At the burning wheel of love Till the side of hate comes up. Therefore in this ancient cup May the sword-blades drink their fill Of the home-brew there, until They will have for master none But the threshold and hearthstone.When you were an acorn on the tree top, Then was I an eagle-cock; Now that you are a withered old block, Still am I an eagle-cock.Love is an immoderate thing And can never be content Till it dip an ageing wing, Where some laughing element Leaps and Time’s old lanthorn dims.

We had only to go across the three fields, We had daylight with us to Ballylee.The table was laid with glasses and a quart measure, She had fair hair, and she sitting beside me; And she said, “Drink, Raftery, and a hundred welcomes, There is a strong cellar in Ballylee.”O star of light and O sun in harvest, O amber hair, O my share of the world, Will you come with me upon Sunday Till we agree together before all the people?[31]I would not grudge you a song every Sunday evening, Punch on the table, or wine if you would drink it, But, O King of Glory, dry the roads before me, Till I find the way to Ballylee.There is sweet air on the side of the hill When you are looking down upon Ballylee; When you are walking in the valley picking nuts and blackberries, There is music of the birds in it and music of the Sidhe.What is the worth of greatness till you have the light Of the flower of the branch that is by your side?

Now words that called up the lightning Are hurtling through my heart.When the flaming lute-thronged angelic door is wide; When an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay; Our hearts endure the scourge, the plaited thorns, the way Crowded with bitter faces, the wounds in palm and side, The hyssop-heavy sponge, the flowers by Kidron stream: We will bend down and loosen our hair over you, That it may drop faint perfume, and be heavy with dew, Lilies of death-pale hope, roses of passionate dream.Though you are in your shining days, Voices among the crowd And new friends busy with your praise, Be not unkind or proud, But think about old friends the most: Time’s bitter flood will rise, Your beauty perish and be lost For all eyes but these eyes.O, women, kneeling by your altar rails long hence, When songs I wove for my beloved hide the prayer, And smoke from this dead heart drifts through the violet air And covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense; Bend down and pray for the great sin I wove in song, Till Mary of the wounded heart cry a sweet cry, And call to my beloved and me: ‘No longer fly Amid the hovering, piteous, penitential throng.’The Powers whose name and shape no living creature knows Have pulled the Immortal Rose; And though the Seven Lights bowed in their dance and wept, The Polar Dragon slept, His heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep: When will he wake from sleep?Great Powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire, With your harmonious choir Encircle her I love and sing her into peace, That my old care may cease; Unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight The nets of day and night.And he saw how the reeds grew dark At the coming of night tide, And dreamed of the long dim hair Of Bridget his bride.[38]Dim Powers of drowsy thought, let her no longer be Like the pale cup of the sea, When winds have gathered and sun and moon burned dim Above its cloudy rim; But let a gentle silence wrought with music flow Whither her footsteps go.Were you but lying cold and dead, And lights were paling out of the West, You would come hither, and bend your head, And I would lay my head on your breast; And you would murmur tender words, Forgiving me, because you were dead: Nor would you rise and hasten away, Though you have the will of the wild birds, But know your hair was bound and wound About the stars and moon and sun: O would, beloved, that you lay Under the dock-leaves in the ground, While lights were paling one by one.Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.I have drunk ale from the Country of the Young And weep because I know all things now: I have been a hazel tree and they hung The Pilot Star and the Crooked Plough Among my leaves in times out of mind: I became a rush that horses tread: I became a man, a hater of the wind, Knowing one, out of all things, alone, that his head Would not lie on the breast or his lips on the hair Of the woman that he loves, until he dies; Although the rushes and the fowl of the air Cry of his love with their pitiful cries.Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro, Between the walls covered with beaten bronze, In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth, Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes, Or on the benches underneath the walls, In comfortable sleep; all living slept But that great queen, who more than half the night Had paced from door to fire and fire to door. Though now in her old age, in her young age She had been beautiful in that old way That’s all but gone; for the proud heart is gone, And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all But soft beauty and indolent desire. [44]She could have called over the rim of the world Whatever woman’s lover had hit her fancy, And yet had been great bodied and great limbed, Fashioned to be the mother of strong children; And she’d had lucky eyes and a high heart, And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax, At need, and made her beautiful and fierce, Sudden and laughing. O unquiet heart, Why do you praise another, praising her, As if there were no tale but your own tale Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound? Have I not bid you tell of that great queen Who has been buried some two thousand years?When night was at its deepest, a wild goose Cried from the porter’s lodge, and with long clamour Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks; But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power Had filled the house with Druid heaviness; [45]And wondering who of the many-changing Sidhe Had come as in the old times to counsel her, Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall, being old, To that small chamber by the outer gate. The porter slept, although he sat upright With still and stony limbs and open eyes. Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise Broke from his parted lips and broke again, She laid a hand on either of his shoulders, And shook him wide awake, and bid him say Who of the wandering many-changing ones Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs More still than they had been for a good month, He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing, He could remember when he had had fine dreams. It was before the time of the great war Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.She turned away; he turned again to sleep That no god troubled now, and, wondering What matters were afoot among the Sidhe, Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh [46]Lifted the curtain of her sleeping-room, Remembering that she too had seemed divine To many thousand eyes, and to her own One that the generations had long waited That work too difficult for mortal hands Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there, And thought of days when he’d had a straight body, And of that famous Fergus, Nessa’s husband, Who had been the lover of her middle life.Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep, And not with his own voice or a man’s voice, But with the burning, live, unshaken voice Of those that it may be can never age. He said, ‘High Queen of Cruachan and Magh Ai, A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.’ And with glad voice Maeve answered him, ‘What king Of the far wandering shadows has come to me? As in the old days when they would come and go About my threshold to counsel and to help.’ The parted lips replied, ‘I seek your help, [47]For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love.’ ‘How may a mortal whose life gutters out Help them that wander with hand clasping hand, Their haughty images that cannot wither For all their beauty’s like a hollow dream, Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain Nor the cold North has troubled?’ He replied: ‘I am from those rivers and I bid you call The children of the Maines out of sleep, And set them digging into Anbual’s hill. We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house, Will overthrow his shadows and carry off Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love. I helped your fathers when they built these walls, And I would have your help in my great need, Queen of high Cruachan.’ ‘I obey your will With speedy feet and a most thankful heart: For you have been, O Aengus of the birds, Our giver of good counsel and good luck.’ And with a groan, as if the mortal breath Could but awaken sadly upon lips That happier breath had moved, her husband turned [48]Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep; But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot, Came to the threshold of the painted house, Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud, Until the pillared dark began to stir With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.She told them of the many-changing ones; And all that night, and all through the next day To middle night, they dug into the hill. At middle night great cats with silver claws, Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls, Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds With long white bodies came out of the air Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.The Maines’ children dropped their spades, and stood With quaking joints and terror-strucken faces, Till Maeve called out: ‘These are but common men. The Maines’ children have not dropped their spades, Because Earth, crazy for its broken power, Casts up a show and the winds answer it With holy shadows.’ Her high heart was glad, [49]And when the uproar ran along the grass She followed with light footfall in the midst, Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.He heard while he sang and dreamed A piper piping away, And never was piping so sad, And never was piping so gay.Friend of these many years, you too had stood With equal courage in that whirling rout; For you, although you’ve not her wandering heart, Have all that greatness, and not hers alone. For there is no high story about queens In any ancient book but tells of you; And when I’ve heard how they grew old and died, Or fell into unhappiness, I’ve said: ‘She will grow old and die, and she has wept!’ And when I’d write it out anew, the words, Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept! Outrun the measure. I’d tell of that great queen Who stood amid a silence by the thorn Until two lovers came out of the air With bodies made out of soft fire. The one, About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings, Said: ‘Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.’ [50]Then Maeve: ‘O Aengus, Master of all lovers, A thousand years ago you held high talk With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan. O when will you grow weary?’ They had vanished; But out of the dark air over her head there came A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.I hardly hear the curlew cry, Nor the grey rush when the wind is high, Before my thoughts begin to run On the heir of Ulad, Buan’s son, Baile, who had the honey mouth; And that mild woman of the south, Aillinn, who was King Lugaid’s heir. Their love was never drowned in care Of this or that thing, nor grew cold Because their bodies had grown old. Being forbid to marry on earth, They blossomed to immortal mirth.About the time when Christ was born, When the long wars for the White Horn [54]And the Brown Bull had not yet come, Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some Called rather Baile Little-Land, Rode out of Emain with a band Of harpers and young men; and they Imagined, as they struck the way To many-pastured Muirthemne, That all things fell out happily, And there, for all that fools had said, Baile and Aillinn would be wed.They found an old man running there: He had ragged long grass-coloured hair; He had knees that stuck out of his hose; He had puddle water in his shoes; He had half a cloak to keep him dry, Although he had a squirrel’s eye.O wandering birds and rushy beds, You put such folly in our heads With all this crying in the wind; No common love is to our mind, And our poor Kate or Nan is less Than any whose unhappiness Awoke the harp-strings long ago. Yet they that know all things but know That all life had to give us is A child’s laughter, a woman’s kiss. [55]Who was it put so great a scorn In the grey reeds that night and morn Are trodden and broken by the herds, And in the light bodies of birds That north wind tumbles to and fro And pinches among hail and snow?That runner said: ‘I am from the south; I run to Baile Honey-Mouth, To tell him how the girl Aillinn Rode from the country of her kin, And old and young men rode with her: For all that country had been astir If anybody half as fair Had chosen a husband anywhere But where it could see her every day. When they had ridden a little way An old man caught the horse’s head With: “You must home again, and wed With somebody in your own land.” A young man cried and kissed her hand, “O lady, wed with one of us”; And when no face grew piteous For any gentle thing she spake, She fell and died of the heart-break.’Because a lover’s heart’s worn out, Being tumbled and blown about [56]By its own blind imagining, And will believe that anything That is bad enough to be true, is true, Baile’s heart was broken in two; And he being laid upon green boughs, Was carried to the goodly house Where the Hound of Ulad sat before The brazen pillars of his door, His face bowed low to weep the end Of the harper’s daughter and her friend. For although years had passed away He always wept them on that day, For on that day they had been betrayed; And now that Honey-Mouth is laid Under a cairn of sleepy stone Before his eyes, he has tears for none, Although he is carrying stone, but two For whom the cairn’s but heaped anew.We hold because our memory is So full of that thing and of this That out of sight is out of mind. But the grey rush under the wind And the grey bird with crooked bill Have such long memories, that they still Remember Deirdre and her man; And when we walk with Kate or Nan About the windy water side, [57]Our heart can hear the voices chide. How could we be so soon content, Who know the way that Naoise went? And they have news of Deirdre’s eyes, Who being lovely was so wise— Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise.Now had that old gaunt crafty one, Gathering his cloak about him, run Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids, Who amid leafy lights and shades Dreamed of the hands that would unlace Their bodices in some dim place When they had come to the marriage bed; And harpers, pondering with bowed head A music that had thought enough Of the ebb of all things to make love Grow gentle without sorrowings; And leather-coated men with slings Who peered about on every side; And amid leafy light he cried: ‘He is well out of wind and wave; They have heaped the stones above his grave In Muirthemne, and over it In changeless Ogham letters writ— Baile, that was of Rury’s seed.‘But the gods long ago decreed [58]No waiting maid should ever spread Baile and Aillinn’s marriage bed, For they should clip and clip again Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain. Therefore it is but little news That put this hurry in my shoes.’And he saw young men and young girls Who danced on a level place And Bridget his bride among them, With a sad and a gay face.And hurrying to the south, he came To that high hill the herdsmen name The Hill Seat of Leighin, because Some god or king had made the laws That held the land together there, In old times among the clouds of the air.That old man climbed; the day grew dim; Two swans came flying up to him, Linked by a gold chain each to each, And with low murmuring laughing speech Alighted on the windy grass. They knew him: his changed body was Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings Were hovering over the harp-strings That Etain, Midhir’s wife, had wove In the hid place, being crazed by love.What shall I call them? fish that swim, Scale rubbing scale where light is dim By a broad water-lily leaf; [59]Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf Forgotten at the threshing place; Or birds lost in the one clear space Of morning light in a dim sky; Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye, Or the door pillars of one house, Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs That have one shadow on the ground; Or the two strings that made one sound Where that wise harper’s finger ran. For this young girl and this young man Have happiness without an end, Because they have made so good a friend.They know all wonders, for they pass The towery gates of Gorias, And Findrias and Falias, And long-forgotten Murias, Among the giant kings whose hoard, Cauldron and spear and stone and sword, Was robbed before earth gave the wheat; Wandering from broken street to street They come where some huge watcher is, And tremble with their love and kiss.They know undying things, for they Wander where earth withers away, Though nothing troubles the great streams [60]But light from the pale stars, and gleams From the holy orchards, where there is none But fruit that is of precious stone, Or apples of the sun and moon.What were our praise to them? they eat Quiet’s wild heart, like daily meat; Who when night thickens are afloat On dappled skins in a glass boat, Far out under a windless sky; While over them birds of Aengus fly, And over the tiller and the prow, And waving white wings to and fro Awaken wanderings of light air To stir their coverlet and their hair.And poets found, old writers say, A yew tree where his body lay; But a wild apple hid the grass With its sweet blossom where hers was; And being in good heart, because A better time had come again After the deaths of many men, And that long fighting at the ford, They wrote on tablets of thin board, Made of the apple and the yew, [61]All the love stories that they knew.Let rush and bird cry out their fill Of the harper’s daughter if they will, Beloved, I am not afraid of her. She is not wiser nor lovelier, And you are more high of heart than she, For all her wanderings over-sea; But I’d have bird and rush forget Those other two; for never yet Has lover lived, but longed to wive Like them that are no more alive.I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees Hum in the lime tree flowers; and put away The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile Tara uprooted, and new commonness Upon the throne and crying about the streets And hanging its paper flowers from post to post, Because it is alone of all things happy. I am contented for I know that Quiet Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer, Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs A cloudy quiver over Parc-na-Lee.August, 1902.
